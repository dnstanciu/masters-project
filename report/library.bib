abstract = {The small-world organization has been hypothesized to reflect a balance between local processing and global integration in the human brain. Previous multimodal imaging studies have consistently demonstrated that the topological architecture of the brain network is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the topological properties of brain alterations in AD. One potential explanation for these inconsistent results lies with the diverse homogeneity and distinct progressive stages of the AD involved in these studies, which are thought to be critical factors that might affect the results. We investigated the topological properties of brain functional networks derived from resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of carefully selected moderate AD patients and normal controls (NCs). Our results showed that the topological properties were found to be disrupted in AD patients, which showing increased local efficiency but decreased global efficiency. We found that the altered brain regions are mainly located in the default mode network, the temporal lobe and certain subcortical regions that are closely associated with the neuropathological changes in AD. Of note, our exploratory study revealed that the ApoE genotype modulates brain network properties, especially in AD patients.},

abstract = {Recent research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shown that the decline of cognitive and memory functions is accompanied by a disrupted neuronal connectivity characterized by white matter (WM) degeneration. However, changes in the topological organization of WM structural network in AD remain largely unknown. Here, we used diffusion tensor image tractography to construct the human brain WM networks of 25 AD patients and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, followed by a graph theoretical analysis. We found that both AD patients and controls had a small-world topology in WM network, suggesting an optimal balance between structurally segregated and integrative organization. More important, the AD patients exhibited increased shortest path length and decreased global efficiency in WM network compared with controls, implying abnormal topological organization. Furthermore, we showed that the WM network contained highly connected hub regions that were predominately located in the precuneus, cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which was consistent with the previous diffusion-MRI studies. Specifically, AD patients were found to have reduced nodal efficiency predominantly located in the frontal regions. Finally, we showed that the alterations of various network properties were significantly correlated with the behavior performances. Together, the present study demonstrated for the first time that the Alzheimer's brain was associated with disrupted topological organization in the large-scale WM structural networks, thus providing the structural evidence for abnormalities of systematic integrity in this disease. This work could also have implications for understanding how the abnormalities of structural connectivity in AD underlie behavioral deficits in the patients.},

@article{Stam2007a,
abstract = {We investigated whether functional brain networks are abnormally organized in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To this end, graph theoretical analysis was applied to matrices of functional connectivity of beta band-filtered electroencephalography (EEG) channels, in 15 Alzheimer patients and 13 control subjects. Correlations between all pairwise combinations of EEG channels were determined with the synchronization likelihood. The resulting synchronization matrices were converted to graphs by applying a threshold, and cluster coefficients and path lengths were computed as a function of threshold or as a function of degree K. For a wide range of thresholds, the characteristic path length L was significantly longer in the Alzheimer patients, whereas the cluster coefficient C showed no significant changes. This pattern was still present when L and C were computed as a function of K. A longer path length with a relatively preserved cluster coefficient suggests a loss of complexity and a less optimal organization. The present study provides further support for the presence of "small-world" features in functional brain networks and demonstrates that AD is characterized by a loss of small-world network characteristics. Graph theoretical analysis may be a useful approach to study the complexity of patterns of interrelations between EEG channels.},

@article{Bassett2012Schizo,
abstract = {The complexity of the human brain's activity and connectivity varies over temporal scales and is altered in disease states such as schizophrenia. Using a multi-level analysis of spontaneous low-frequency fMRI data stretching from the activity of individual brain regions to the coordinated connectivity pattern of the whole brain, we investigate the role of brain signal complexity in schizophrenia. Specifically, we quantitatively characterize the univariate wavelet entropy of regional activity, the bivariate pairwise functional connectivity between regions, and the multivariate network organization of connectivity patterns. Our results indicate that univariate measures of complexity are less sensitive to disease state than higher level bivariate and multivariate measures. While wavelet entropy is unaffected by disease state, the magnitude of pairwise functional connectivity is significantly decreased in schizophrenia and the variance is increased. Furthermore, by considering the network structure as a function of correlation strength, we find that network organization specifically of weak connections is strongly correlated with attention, memory, and negative symptom scores and displays potential as a clinical biomarker, providing up to 75\% classification accuracy and 85\% sensitivity. We also develop a general statistical framework for the testing of group differences in network properties, which is broadly applicable to studies where changes in network organization are crucial to the understanding of brain function.},

abstract = {Recent research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shown that cognitive and memory decline in this disease is accompanied by disrupted changes in the coordination of large-scale brain functional networks. However, alterations in coordinated patterns of structural brain networks in AD are still poorly understood. Here, we used cortical thickness measurement from magnetic resonance imaging to investigate large-scale structural brain networks in 92 AD patients and 97 normal controls. Brain networks were constructed by thresholding cortical thickness correlation matrices of 54 regions and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Compared with controls, AD patients showed decreased cortical thickness intercorrelations between the bilateral parietal regions and increased intercorrelations in several selective regions involving the lateral temporal and parietal cortex as well as the cingulate and medial frontal cortex regions. Specially, AD patients showed abnormal small-world architecture in the structural cortical networks (increased clustering and shortest paths linking individual regions), implying a less optimal topological organization in AD. Moreover, AD patients were associated with reduced nodal centrality predominantly in the temporal and parietal heteromodal association cortex regions and increased nodal centrality in the occipital cortex regions. Finally, the brain networks of AD were about equally as robust to random failures as those of controls, but more vulnerable against targeted attacks, presumably because of the effects of pathological topological organization. Our findings suggest that the coordinated patterns of cortical morphology are widely altered in AD patients, thus providing structural evidence for disrupted integrity in large-scale brain networks that underlie cognition. This work has implications for our understanding of how functional deficits in patients are associated with their underlying structural (morphological) basis.},

abstract = {Antidepressant treatments enhance plasticity and increase neurogenesis in the adult brain, but it has been unclear how these effects influence mood. We propose that, like environmental enrichment and exercise, antidepressant treatments enhance adaptability by increasing structural variability within the nervous system at many levels, from proliferating precursors to immature synaptic contacts. Conversely, sensory deprivation and chronic stress reduce this structural variability. Activity-dependent competition within the mood-related circuits, guided by rehabilitation, then selects for the survival and stabilization of those structures that best represent the internal or external milieu. Increased variability together with competition-mediated selection facilitates normal function, such as pattern separation within the dentate gyrus and other mood-related circuits, thereby enhancing adaptability toward novel experiences.},

abstract = {Complex networks have been observed to comprise small-world properties, believed to represent an optimal organization of local specialization and global integration of information processing at reduced wiring cost. Here, we applied magnitude squared coherence to resting magnetoencephalographic time series in reconstructed source space, acquired from controls and patients with schizophrenia, and generated frequency-dependent adjacency matrices modeling functional connectivity between virtual channels. After configuring undirected binary and weighted graphs, we found that all human networks demonstrated highly localized clustering and short characteristic path lengths. The most conservatively thresholded networks showed efficient wiring, with topographical distance between connected vertices amounting to one-third as observed in surrogate randomized topologies. Nodal degrees of the human networks conformed to a heavy-tailed exponentially truncated power-law, compatible with the existence of hubs, which included theta and alpha bilateral cerebellar tonsil, beta and gamma bilateral posterior cingulate, and bilateral thalamus across all frequencies. We conclude that all networks showed small-worldness, minimal physical connection distance, and skewed degree distributions characteristic of physically-embedded networks, and that these calculations derived from graph theoretical mathematics did not quantifiably distinguish between subject populations, independent of bandwidth. However, post-hoc measurements of edge computations at the scale of the individual vertex revealed trends of reduced gamma connectivity across the posterior medial parietal cortex in patients, an observation consistent with our prior resting activation study that found significant reduction of synthetic aperture magnetometry gamma power across similar regions. The basis of these small differences remains unclear.},

Recent insights into this question have come from studies relying on simultaneous recording of neurons in multiple brain regions during learning. This approach has revealed that in emotionally arousing conditions, whether positively or negatively valenced, the amygdala allows incoming information to be processed more efficiently in distributed cerebral networks. This review also highlights the need to understand how different brain regions act in parallel to efficiently achieve one goal.},

abstract = {Structural and functional underconnectivity have been reported for multiple brain regions, functional systems, and white matter tracts in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although recent developments in complex network analysis have established that the brain is a modular network exhibiting small-world properties, network level organization has not been carefully examined in ASD. Here we used resting-state functional MRI (n = 42 ASD, n = 37 typically developing; TD) to show that children and adolescents with ASD display reduced short and long-range connectivity within functional systems (i.e., reduced functional integration) and stronger connectivity between functional systems (i.e., reduced functional segregation), particularly in default and higher-order visual regions. Using graph theoretical methods, we show that pairwise group differences in functional connectivity are reflected in network level reductions in modularity and clustering (local efficiency), but shorter characteristic path lengths (higher global efficiency). Structural networks, generated from diffusion tensor MRI derived fiber tracts (n = 51 ASD, n = 43 TD), displayed lower levels of white matter integrity yet higher numbers of fibers. TD and ASD individuals exhibited similar levels of correlation between raw measures of structural and functional connectivity (n = 35 ASD, n = 35 TD). However, a principal component analysis combining structural and functional network properties revealed that the balance of local and global efficiency between structural and functional networks was reduced in ASD, positively correlated with age, and inversely correlated with ASD symptom severity. Overall, our findings suggest that modeling the brain as a complex network will be highly informative in unraveling the biological basis of ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {AIM: Preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) combined with tractography can be used to assess non-invasively white matter microstructure and brain development in preterm infants. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review of the current evidence obtained from tractography studies of preterm infants in whom MRI was performed up to term-equivalent age.

METHOD: Databases were searched for dMRI tractography studies of preterm infants.

RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were assessed. The most frequently assessed tracts included the corticospinal tract, the corpus callosum, and the optic radiations. The superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the anterior and superior thalamic radiations were investigated less frequently. A clear relationship exists between diffusion metrics and postmenstrual age at the time of scanning, although the evidence of an effect of gestational age at birth and white matter injury is conflicting. Sex and laterality may play an important role in the relationship between diffusion metrics, early clinical assessment, and outcomes.

INTERPRETATION: Studies involving infants of all gestational ages are required to elucidate the relationship between gestational age and diffusion metrics, and to establish the utility of tractography as a predictive tool. There is a need for more robust acquisition and analysis methods to improve the accuracy of assessing development of white matter pathways.},

abstract = {Brain anatomical networks are sparse, complex, and have economical small-world properties. We investigated the efficiency and cost of human brain functional networks measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a factorial design: two groups of healthy old (N = 11; mean age = 66.5 years) and healthy young (N = 15; mean age = 24.7 years) volunteers were each scanned twice in a no-task or "resting" state following placebo or a single dose of a dopamine receptor antagonist (sulpiride 400 mg). Functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated by wavelet correlation analysis, in the frequency interval 0.06-0.11 Hz, and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. These brain functional networks were small-world and economical in the sense of providing high global and local efficiency of parallel information processing for low connection cost. Efficiency was reduced disproportionately to cost in older people, and the detrimental effects of age on efficiency were localised to frontal and temporal cortical and subcortical regions. Dopamine antagonism also impaired global and local efficiency of the network, but this effect was differentially localised and did not interact with the effect of age. Brain functional networks have economical small-world properties-supporting efficient parallel information transfer at relatively low cost-which are differently impaired by normal aging and pharmacological blockade of dopamine transmission.},

abstract = {The quantification of phase synchrony between neuronal signals is of crucial importance for the study of large-scale interactions in the brain. Two methods have been used to date in neuroscience, based on two distinct approaches which permit a direct estimation of the instantaneous phase of a signal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 (1998) 3291; Human Brain Mapping 8 (1999) 194]. The phase is either estimated by using the analytic concept of Hilbert transform or, alternatively, by convolution with a complex wavelet. In both methods the stability of the instantaneous phase over a window of time requires quantification by means of various statistical dependence parameters (standard deviation, Shannon entropy or mutual information). The purpose of this paper is to conduct a direct comparison between these two methods on three signal sets: (1) neural models; (2) intracranial signals from epileptic patients; and (3) scalp EEG recordings. Levels of synchrony that can be considered as reliable are estimated by using the technique of surrogate data. Our results demonstrate that the differences between the methods are minor, and we conclude that they are fundamentally equivalent for the study of neuroelectrical signals. This offers a common language and framework that can be used for future research in the area of synchronization.},

abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the human brain. It has been suggested that fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during rest reflect the neuronal baseline activity of the brain, representing the state of the human brain in the absence of goal-directed neuronal action and external input, and that these slow fluctuations correspond to functionally relevant resting-state networks. Several studies on resting fMRI have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of these resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and quantified. In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called tensor probabilistic independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data to find coherencies that are consistent across subjects and sessions. We characterize and quantify the consistency of these effects by using a bootstrapping approach, and we estimate the BOLD amplitude modulation as well as the voxel-wise cross-subject variation. The analysis found 10 patterns with potential functional relevance, consisting of regions known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive functioning, auditory processing, memory, and the so-called default-mode network, each with BOLD signal changes up to 3\%. In general, areas with a high mean percentage BOLD signal are consistent and show the least variation around the mean. These findings show that the baseline activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant temporal dynamics, with percentage BOLD signal change comparable with the signal changes found in task-related experiments.},

abstract = {The rodent brain is organized into functional networks that can be studied through examination of synchronized low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations (LFFs) of the functional magnetic resonance imaging -blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. In this study, resting networks of LFFs were estimated from the whole-brain BOLD signals using independent component analysis (ICA). ICA provides a hypothesis-free technique for determining the functional connectivity map that does not require a priori selection of a seed region. Twenty Long-Evans rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1\%, n = 10) or ketamine/xylazine (50/6 mg . kg(-1) . h(-1) ip, n = 10) and imaged for 5-10 min in a 9.4 T MR scanner without experimental stimulation or task requirement. Independent, synchronous LFFs of BOLD signals were found to exist in clustered, bilaterally symmetric regions of both cortical and subcortical structures, including primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, motor cortices, visual cortices, posterior and anterior cingulate cortices, hippocampi, caudate-putamen, and thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. The somatosensory and motor cortices typically demonstrated both symmetric and asymmetric components with unique frequency profiles. Similar independent network components were found under isoflurane and ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. The report demonstrates, for the first time, 12 independent resting networks that are bilaterally synchronous in different cortical and subcortical areas of the rat brain.},

abstract = {In this paper, complex dynamical synchronization in a non-linear model of a neural system is studied, and the computational significance of the behaviours is explored. The local neural dynamics is determined by voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and feedback between densely interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. A mesoscopic array of local networks is modelled by introducing coupling between the local networks via weak excitatory-to-excitatory connectivity. It is shown that with modulation of this long-range synaptic coupling, the system undergoes a transition from independent oscillations to stable chaotic synchronization. Between these states exists a 'weakly' stable state associated with complex, intermittent behaviour in the temporal domain and clusters of synchronous regions in the spatial domain. The paper concludes with a discussion of the putative relevance of such processes in the brain, including the role of neuromodulatory systems and the mechanisms underlying sensory perception, adaptation, computation and complexity.},

Pain and fear may, however, become maladaptive if expressed under inappropriate conditions or at excessive intensities for extended durations. Currently emerging concepts of maladaptive pain and fear suggest that basic neuronal mechanisms of memory formation are relevant for the development of pathological forms of pain and fear. Thus, the processes of erasing memory traces of pain and fear may constitute promising targets for future therapies.},

abstract = {In Alzheimer's disease (AD), structural and functional brain network organization is disturbed. However, many of the present network analysis measures require a priori assumptions and methodological choices that influence outcomes and interpretations. Graph spectral analysis (GSA) is a more direct algebraic method that describes network properties, which might lead to more reliable results. In this study, GSA was applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to explore functional network integrity in AD. Sensor-level resting-state MEG was performed in 18 Alzheimer patients (age 67 ± 9, 6 women) and 18 healthy controls (age 66 ± 9, 11 women). Weighted, undirected graphs were constructed based on functional connectivity analysis using the Synchronization likelihood, and GSA was performed with a focus on network connectivity, synchronizability, and node centrality. The main outcomes were a global loss of network connectivity and altered synchronizability in most frequency bands. Eigenvector centrality mapping confirmed the hub status of the parietal areas, and demonstrated a low centrality of the left temporal region in the theta band in AD patients that was strongly related to the mini mental state examination (global cognitive function test) score (r=0.67, p=0.001). Summarizing, GSA is a theoretically solid approach that is able to detect the disruption of functional network topology in AD. In addition to the previously reported overall connectivity losses and parietal area hub status, impaired network synchronizability and a clinically relevant left temporal centrality loss were found in AD patients. Our findings imply that GSA is valuable for the purpose of studying altered brain network topology and dynamics in AD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent neuroimaging analyses aim to understand how information is integrated across brain regions that have traditionally been studied in isolation; however, detecting functional connectivity networks in experimental EEG recordings is a non-trivial task. NEW METHOD: We use neural mass models to simulate 10-s trials with coupling between 1-3 and 5-8s and compare how well three phase-based connectivity measures recover this connectivity pattern across a set of experimentally relevant conditions: variable oscillation frequency and power spectrum, feed forward connections with or without feedback, and simulated signals with and without volume conduction. RESULTS: Overall, the results highlight successful detection of the onset and offset of significant synchronizations for a majority of the 28 simulated configurations; however, the tested phase measures sometimes differ in their sensitivity and specificity to the underlying connectivity. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Prior work has shown that these phase measures perform well on signals generated by a computational model of coupled oscillators. In this work we extend previous studies by exploring the performance of these measures on a different class of computational models, and we compare the methods on 28 variations that capture a set of experimentally relevant conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore that no single phase synchronization measure is substantially better than all others, and experimental investigations will likely benefit from combining a set of measures together that are chosen based on both the experimental question of interest, the signal to noise ratio in the EEG data, and the approach used for statistical significance.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability.

abstract = {Children born prematurely have a high incidence of visual disorders which cannot always be explained by focal retinal or brain lesions. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that visual function in preterm infants is related to the microstructural development of white matter in the optic radiations. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with probabilistic diffusion tractography to delineate the optic radiations at term equivalent age and compared the fractional anisotropy (FA) to a contemporaneous evaluation of visual function. Thirty-seven preterm infants (19 male) born at median (range) 28(+4) (24(+1)-32(+3)) weeks gestational age, were examined at a post-menstrual age of 42 (39(+6)-43) weeks. MRI and DTI were acquired on a 3 Tesla MR system with DTI obtained in 15 non-collinear directions with a b value of 750 s/mm(2). Tracts were generated from a seed mask placed in the white matter lateral to the lateral geniculate nucleus and mean FA values of these tracts were determined. Visual assessment was performed using a battery of nine items assessing different aspects of visual abilities. Ten infants had evidence of cerebral lesions on conventional MRI. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the visual assessment score was independently correlated with FA values, but not gestational age at birth, post-menstrual age at scan or the presence of lesions on conventional MRI. The occurrence of mild retinopathy of prematurity did not affect the FA measures or visual scores. We then performed a secondary analysis using tract-based spatial statistics to determine whether global brain white matter development was related to visual function and found that only FA in the optic radiations was correlated with visual assessment score. Our results suggest that in preterm infants at term equivalent age visual function is directly related to the development of white matter in the optic radiations.},

In particular we describe the relationship between nonparametric estimates of PLV and PLI and the parameters of two distributions that can both be used to model phase interactions. The first of these is the von Mises distribution, for which the sample PLV is a maximum likelihood estimator. The second is the relative phase distribution associated with bivariate circularly symmetric complex Gaussian data. We derive an explicit expression for the PLV for this distribution and show that it is a function of the cross-correlation between the two signals. We compare the bias and variance of the sample PLV and the PLV computed from the cross-correlation. We also show that both the von Mises and Gaussian models are suitable for representing relative phase in application to LFP data from a visually-cued motor study in macaque. We then compare results using the two different PLV estimators and conclude that, for this data, the sample PLV provides equivalent information to the cross-correlation of the two complex time series.},

abstract = {The brain representation of the body, called the body schema, is susceptible to plasticity. For instance, subjects experiencing a rubber hand illusion develop a sense of ownership of a mannequin hand when they view it being touched while tactile stimuli are simultaneously applied to their own hand. Here, the cortical basis of such an embodiment was investigated through concurrent recordings from primary somatosensory (i.e., S1) and motor (i.e., M1) cortical neuronal ensembles while two monkeys observed an avatar arm being touched by a virtual ball. Following a period when virtual touches occurred synchronously with physical brushes of the monkeys' arms, neurons in S1 and M1 started to respond to virtual touches applied alone. Responses to virtual touch occurred 50 to 70 ms later than to physical touch, consistent with the involvement of polysynaptic pathways linking the visual cortex to S1 and M1. We propose that S1 and M1 contribute to the rubber hand illusion and that, by taking advantage of plasticity in these areas, patients may assimilate neuroprosthetic limbs as parts of their body schema.},

abstract = {Understanding early human brain development is of great clinical importance, as many neurological and neurobehavioral disorders have their origin in early structural and functional cerebral organization and maturation. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a recent magnetic resonance (MR) modality which assesses water diffusion in biological tissues at a microstructural level, has revealed a powerful technique to explore the structural basis of normal brain development. In fact, the tissue organization can be probed non-invasively, and the age-related changes of diffusion parameters (mean diffusivity, anisotropy) reveal crucial maturational processes, such as white matter myelination. Nevertheless, the developing human brain presents several challenges for DTI applications compared with the adult brain. DTI may further be used to detect brain injury well before conventional MRI, as water diffusion changes are an early indicator of cellular injury. This is particularly critical in infants in the context of administration of neuroprotective therapies. Changes in diffusion characteristics further provide early evidence of both focal and diffuse white matter injury in association with periventricular leukomalacia in the preterm infant. Finally, with the development of 3D fiber tractography, the maturation of white matter connectivity can be followed throughout infant development into adulthood with the potential to study correlations between abnormalities on DTI and ultimate neurologic/cognitive outcome.},

Here we explored the anatomy and function of the default network across three studies to resolve divergent hypotheses about its contributions to spontaneous cognition and active forms of decision making. Analysis of intrinsic activity revealed the network comprises multiple, dissociated components. A midline core (posterior cingulate and anterior medial prefrontal cortex) is active when people make self-relevant, affective decisions. In contrast, a medial temporal lobe subsystem becomes engaged when decisions involve constructing a mental scene based on memory. During certain experimentally directed and spontaneous acts of future-oriented thought, these dissociated components are simultaneously engaged, presumably to facilitate construction of mental models of personally significant events.},

Because electric currents of the brain are believed to strongly diffuse before reaching the scalp surface, higher-density electrode coverage is often deemed unnecessary. We used an ultra-dense electroencephalography (ud-EEG) sensor array to reveal strong potential variation at 1cm scale and discovered that it reflects functional brain activity. A new classification paradigm demonstrates that ud-EEG provides twice the signal to noise ratio for brain-response classification compared with contemporary hd-EEG. These results suggest a paradigm shift from current thinking by showing that higher spatial resolution sampling of EEG is required and leads to increased functional brain information that is useful for diverse neurological applications.},

Here, we present a framework for considering potential roles of metaplasticity across three domains of function. First, metaplasticity appears ideally placed to prepare for subsequent learning by either enhancing learning ability generally or by preparing neuronal networks to encode specific content. Second, metaplasticity can homeostatically regulate synaptic plasticity, and this likely has important behavioural consequences by stabilising synaptic weights while ensuring the ongoing availability of synaptic plasticity. Finally, we discuss emerging evidence that metaplasticity mechanisms may play a role in disease causally and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.},

I analyze whether these behaviors, which appear particularly complex, can be explained on the basis of elemental associative learning and specific neural circuitries or, by contrast, require an explanatory level that goes beyond simple associative links. In doing this, I highlight experimental challenges and suggest future directions for investigating the neurobiology of higher-order learning in insects, with the goal of uncovering the basic neural architectures underlying cognitive processing.},

abstract = {Interactions between functionally specialized brain regions are crucial for normal brain function. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) are techniques suited to capture these interactions, because they provide whole head measurements of brain activity in the millisecond range. More than one sensor picks up the activity of an underlying source. This field spread severely limits the utility of connectivity measures computed directly between sensor recordings. Consequentially, neuronal interactions should be studied on the level of the reconstructed sources. This article reviews several methods that have been applied to investigate interactions between brain regions in source space. We will mainly focus on the different measures used to quantify connectivity, and on the different strategies adopted to identify regions of interest. Despite various successful accounts of MEG and EEG source connectivity, caution with respect to the interpretation of the results is still warranted. This is due to the fact that effects of field spread can never be completely abolished in source space. However, in this very exciting and developing field of research this cautionary note should not discourage researchers from further investigation into the connectivity between neuronal sources.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in neuroimaging techniques provide great potentials for study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing findings have shown that AD is closely related to alteration in the functional brain network, i.e., the functional connectivity between different brain regions. In this paper, we propose a method based on sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) to identify functional brain connectivity networks from PET data. Our method is able to identify both the connectivity network structure and strength for a large number of brain regions with small sample sizes. We apply the proposed method to the PET data of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC) subjects. Compared with NC, AD shows decrease in the amount of inter-region functional connectivity within the temporal lobe especially between the area around hippocampus and other regions and increase in the amount of connectivity within the frontal lobe as well as between the parietal and occipital lobes. Also, AD shows weaker between-lobe connectivity than within-lobe connectivity and weaker between-hemisphere connectivity, compared with NC. In addition to being a method for knowledge discovery about AD, the proposed SICE method can also be used for classifying new subjects, which makes it a suitable approach for novel connectivity-based AD biomarker identification. Our experiments show that the best sensitivity and specificity our method can achieve in AD vs. NC classification are 88\% and 88\%, respectively.},

abstract = {This study assesses the connectivity alterations caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in magnetoencephalogram (MEG) background activity. Moreover, a novel methodology to adaptively extract brain rhythms from the MEG is introduced. This methodology relies on the ability of empirical mode decomposition to isolate local signal oscillations and constrained blind source separation to extract the activity that jointly represents a subset of channels. Inter-regional MEG connectivity was analysed for 36 AD, 18 MCI and 26 control subjects in $\delta$, $\theta$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands over left and right central, anterior, lateral and posterior regions with magnitude squared coherence-c(f). For the sake of comparison, c(f) was calculated from the original MEG channels and from the adaptively extracted rhythms. The results indicated that AD and MCI cause slight alterations in the MEG connectivity. Computed from the extracted rhythms, c(f) distinguished AD and MCI subjects from controls with 69.4\% and 77.3\% accuracies, respectively, in a full leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation. These values were higher than those obtained without the proposed extraction methodology.},

abstract = {The magnetoencephalogram (MEG) is contaminated with undesired signals, which are called artifacts. Some of the most important ones are the cardiac and the ocular artifacts (CA and OA, respectively), and the power line noise (PLN). Blind source separation (BSS) has been used to reduce the influence of the artifacts in the data. There is a plethora of BSS-based artifact removal approaches, but few comparative analyses. In this study, MEG background activity from 26 subjects was processed with five widespread BSS (AMUSE, SOBI, JADE, extended Infomax, and FastICA) and one constrained BSS (cBSS) techniques. Then, the ability of several combinations of BSS algorithm, epoch length, and artifact detection metric to automatically reduce the CA, OA, and PLN were quantified with objective criteria. The results pinpointed to cBSS as a very suitable approach to remove the CA. Additionally, a combination of AMUSE or SOBI and artifact detection metrics based on entropy or power criteria decreased the OA. Finally, the PLN was reduced by means of a spectral metric. These findings confirm the utility of BSS to help in the artifact removal for MEG background activity.},

abstract = {Simultaneously combining the complementary assets of EEG, functional MRI (fMRI), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) within one experimental session provides synergetic results, offering insights into brain function that go beyond the scope of each method when used in isolation. The steady increase of concurrent EEG-fMRI, TMS-EEG, and TMS-fMRI studies further underlines the added value of such multimodal imaging approaches. Whereas concurrent EEG-fMRI enables monitoring of brain-wide network dynamics with high temporal and spatial resolution, the combination with TMS provides insights in causal interactions within these networks. Thus the simultaneous use of all three methods would allow studying fast, spatially accurate, and distributed causal interactions in the perturbed system and its functional relevance for intact behavior. Concurrent EEG-fMRI, TMS-EEG, and TMS-fMRI experiments are already technically challenging, and the three-way combination of TMS-EEG-fMRI might yield additional difficulties in terms of hardware strain or signal quality. The present study explored the feasibility of concurrent TMS-EEG-fMRI studies by performing safety and quality assurance tests based on phantom and human data combining existing commercially available hardware. Results revealed that combined TMS-EEG-fMRI measurements were technically feasible, safe in terms of induced temperature changes, allowed functional MRI acquisition with comparable image quality as during concurrent EEG-fMRI or TMS-fMRI, and provided artifact-free EEG before and from 300 ms after TMS pulse application. Based on these empirical findings, we discuss the conceptual benefits of this novel complementary approach to investigate the working human brain and list a number of precautions and caveats to be heeded when setting up such multimodal imaging facilities with current hardware.},

abstract = {Sensory neuroprostheses show great potential for alleviating major sensory deficits. It is not known, however, whether such devices can augment the subject's normal perceptual range. Here we show that adult rats can learn to perceive otherwise invisible infrared light through a neuroprosthesis that couples the output of a head-mounted infrared sensor to their somatosensory cortex (S1) via intracortical microstimulation. Rats readily learn to use this new information source, and generate active exploratory strategies to discriminate among infrared signals in their environment. S1 neurons in these infrared-perceiving rats respond to both whisker deflection and intracortical microstimulation, suggesting that the infrared representation does not displace the original tactile representation. Hence, sensory cortical prostheses, in addition to restoring normal neurological functions, may serve to expand natural perceptual capabilities in mammals.},

@article{Smith2006,
abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies.},

abstract = {Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data offers new insights into the pathophysiology of neurological disease and mechanisms of effective therapies. Current applications can be used both to identify the most likely functional brain network underlying observed data and estimate the networks' connectivity parameters. We examined the reproducibility of DCM in healthy subjects (young 18-48 years, n=27; old 50-80 years, n=15) in the context of action selection. We then examined the effects of Parkinson's disease (50-78 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-2.5, n=16) and dopaminergic therapy. Forty-eight models were compared, for each of 90 sessions from 58 subjects. Model-evidences clustered according to sets of structurally similar models, with high correlations over two sessions in healthy older subjects. The same model was identified as most likely in healthy controls on both sessions and in medicated patients. In this most likely network model, the selection of action was associated with enhanced coupling between prefrontal cortex and the pre-supplementary motor area. However, the parameters for intrinsic connectivity and contextual modulation in this model were poorly correlated across sessions. A different model was identified in patients with Parkinson's disease after medication withdrawal. In "off" patients, action selection was associated with enhanced connectivity from prefrontal to lateral premotor cortex. This accords with independent evidence of a dopamine-dependent functional disconnection of the SMA in Parkinson's disease. Together, these results suggest that DCM model selection is robust and sensitive enough to study clinical populations and their pharmacological treatment. For critical inferences, model selection may be sufficient. However, caution is required when comparing groups or drug effects in terms of the connectivity parameter estimates, if there are significant posterior covariances among parameters.},

abstract = {The brain can be regarded as a network: a connected system where nodes, or units, represent different specialized regions and links, or connections, represent communication pathways. From a functional perspective communication is coded by temporal dependence between the activities of different brain areas. In the last decade, the abstract representation of the brain as a graph has allowed to visualize functional brain networks and describe their non-trivial topological properties in a compact and objective way. Nowadays, the use of graph analysis in translational neuroscience has become essential to quantify brain dysfunctions in terms of aberrant reconfiguration of functional brain networks. Despite its evident impact, graph analysis of functional brain networks is not a simple toolbox that can be blindly applied to brain signals. On the one hand, it requires a know-how of all the methodological steps of the processing pipeline that manipulates the input brain signals and extract the functional network properties. On the other hand, a knowledge of the neural phenomenon under study is required to perform physiological-relevant analysis. The aim of this review is to provide practical indications to make sense of brain network analysis and contrast counterproductive attitudes.},

@article{Keshtkaran2014,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Power line interference may severely corrupt neural recordings at 50/60 Hz and harmonic frequencies. The interference is usually non-stationary and can vary in frequency, amplitude and phase. To retrieve the gamma-band oscillations at the contaminated frequencies, it is desired to remove the interference without compromising the actual neural signals at the interference frequency bands. In this paper, we present a robust and computationally efficient algorithm for removing power line interference from neural recordings. APPROACH: The algorithm includes four steps. First, an adaptive notch filter is used to estimate the fundamental frequency of the interference. Subsequently, based on the estimated frequency, harmonics are generated by using discrete-time oscillators, and then the amplitude and phase of each harmonic are estimated by using a modified recursive least squares algorithm. Finally, the estimated interference is subtracted from the recorded data. MAIN RESULTS: The algorithm does not require any reference signal, and can track the frequency, phase and amplitude of each harmonic. When benchmarked with other popular approaches, our algorithm performs better in terms of noise immunity, convergence speed and output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While minimally affecting the signal bands of interest, the algorithm consistently yields fast convergence (<100 ms) and substantial interference rejection (output SNR >30 dB) in different conditions of interference strengths (input SNR from -30 to 30 dB), power line frequencies (45-65 Hz) and phase and amplitude drifts. In addition, the algorithm features a straightforward parameter adjustment since the parameters are independent of the input SNR, input signal power and the sampling rate. A hardware prototype was fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process and tested. Software implementation of the algorithm has been made available for open access at https://github.com/mrezak/removePLI. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed algorithm features a highly robust operation, fast adaptation to interference variations, significant SNR improvement, low computational complexity and memory requirement and straightforward parameter adjustment. These features render the algorithm suitable for wearable and implantable sensor applications, where reliable and real-time cancellation of the interference is desired.},

@article{VanDiessen2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition is routinely performed to support an epileptic origin of paroxysmal events in patients referred with a possible diagnosis of epilepsy. However, in children with partial epilepsies the interictal EEGs are often normal. We aimed to develop a multivariable diagnostic prediction model based on electroencephalogram functional network characteristics. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Routinely performed interictal EEG recordings at first presentation of 35 children diagnosed with partial epilepsies, and of 35 children in whom the diagnosis epilepsy was excluded (control group), were used to develop the prediction model. Children with partial epilepsy were individually matched on age and gender with children from the control group. Periods of resting-state EEG, free of abnormal slowing or epileptiform activity, were selected to construct functional networks of correlated activity. We calculated multiple network characteristics previously used in functional network epilepsy studies and used these measures to build a robust, decision tree based, prediction model. Based on epileptiform EEG activity only, EEG results supported the diagnosis of with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.77 and 0.91 respectively. In contrast, the prediction model had a sensitivity of 0.96 [95\% confidence interval: 0.78-1.00] and specificity of 0.95 [95\% confidence interval: 0.76-1.00] in correctly differentiating patients from controls. The overall discriminative power, quantified as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 0.89, defined as an excellent model performance. The need of a multivariable network analysis to improve diagnostic accuracy was emphasized by the lack of discriminatory power using single network characteristics or EEG's power spectral density. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Diagnostic accuracy in children with partial epilepsy is substantially improved with a model combining functional network characteristics derived from multi-channel electroencephalogram recordings. Early and accurate diagnosis is important to start necessary treatment as soon as possible and inform patients and parents on possible risks and psychosocial aspects in relation to the diagnosis.},

abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; \$67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by \beta-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, \beta-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The ADNI study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants.},

abstract = {The subject of this article is detection of brain magnetic fields, or magnetoencephalography (MEG). The brain fields are many orders of magnitude smaller than the environmental magnetic noise and their measurement represent a significant metrological challenge. The only detectors capable of resolving such small fields and at the same time handling the large dynamic range of the environmental noise are superconducting quantum interference devices (or SQUIDs). The SQUIDs are coupled to the brain magnetic fields using combinations of superconducting coils called flux transformers (primary sensors). The environmental noise is attenuated by a combination of shielding, primary sensor geometry, and synthetic methods. One of the most successful synthetic methods for noise elimination is synthetic higher-order gradiometers. How the gradiometers can be synthesized is shown and examples of their noise cancellation effectiveness are given. The MEG signals measured on the scalp surface must be interpreted and converted into information about the distribution of currents within the brain. This task is complicated by the fact that such inversion is nonunique. Additional mathematical simplifications, constraints, or assumptions must be employed to obtain useful source images. Methods for the interpretation of the MEG signals include the popular point current dipole, minimum norm methods, spatial filtering, beamformers, MUSIC, and Bayesian techniques. The use of synthetic aperture magnetometry (a class of beamformers) is illustrated in examples of interictal epileptic spiking and voluntary hand-motor activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Considering the increasing use of complexity estimates in neuropsychiatric populations, a normative study is critical to define the 'normal' behaviour of brain oscillatory complexity across the life span.

METHOD: This study examines changes in resting-state magnetoencephalogram (MEG) complexity - quantified with the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) algorithm - due to age and gender in a large sample of 222 (100 males/122 females) healthy participants with ages ranging from 7 to 84 years.

RESULTS: A significant quadratic (curvilinear) relationship (p<0.05) between age and complexity was found, with LZC maxima being reached by the sixth decade of life. Once that peak was crossed, complexity values slowly decreased until late senescence. Females exhibited higher LZC values than males, with significant differences in the anterior, central and posterior regions (p<0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the evolution of brain oscillatory complexity across the life span might be considered a new illustration of a 'normal' physiological rhythm.

SIGNIFICANCE: Previous and forthcoming clinical studies using complexity estimates might be interpreted from a more complete and dynamical perspective. Pathologies not only cause an 'abnormal' increase or decrease of complexity values but they actually 'break' the 'normal' pattern of oscillatory complexity evolution as a function of age.},

abstract = {Dense array EEG is a method of recording electroencephalography (EEG) with many more electrodes (up to 256) than is utilized with standard techniques that typically employ 19-21 scalp electrodes. The rationale for this approach is to enhance the spatial resolution of scalp EEG. In our research, dense array EEG is used in conjunction with a realistic model of head tissue conductivity and methods of electrographic source analysis to determine cerebral cortical localization of epileptiform discharges. In studies of patients with absence seizures, only localized cortical regions are involved during the attack. Typically, absences are accompanied by "wave-spike" complexes that show, both at the beginning and throughout the ictus, repetitive cycles of stereotyped, localized involvement of mainly mesial and orbital frontal cortex. Dense array EEG can also be used for long-term EEG video monitoring (LTM). We have used dense array EEG LTM to capture seizures in over 40 patients with medically refractory localization-related epilepsy, including both temporal and extra temporal cases, where standard LTM failed to reveal reliable ictal localization. One research goal is to test the validity of dense array LTM findings by comparison with invasive LTM and surgical outcome. Collection of a prospective series of surgical candidates who undergo both procedures is currently underway. Analysis of subjects with either generalized or localization-related seizures suggest that all seizures, including those traditionally classified as "generalized," propagate through discrete cortical networks. Furthermore, based on initial review of propagation patterns, we hypothesize that all epileptic seizures may be fundamentally corticothalamic or corticolimbic in nature. Dense array EEG may prove useful in noninvasive ictal localization, when standard methods fail. Future research will determine if the method will reduce the need for invasive EEG recordings, or assist in the appropriate placement of novel treatment devices.},

abstract = {Recent functional imaging studies have revealed coactivation in a distributed network of cortical regions that characterizes the resting state, or default mode, of the human brain. Among the brain regions implicated in this network, several, including the posterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobes, have also shown decreased metabolism early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We reasoned that default-mode network activity might therefore be abnormal in AD. To test this hypothesis, we used independent component analysis to isolate the network in a group of 13 subjects with mild AD and in a group of 13 age-matched elderly controls as they performed a simple sensory-motor processing task. Three important findings are reported. Prominent coactivation of the hippocampus, detected in all groups, suggests that the default-mode network is closely involved with episodic memory processing. The AD group showed decreased resting-state activity in the posterior cingulate and hippocampus, suggesting that disrupted connectivity between these two regions accounts for the posterior cingulate hypometabolism commonly detected in positron emission tomography studies of early AD. Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis applied at the individual subject level suggests that activity in the default-mode network may ultimately prove a sensitive and specific biomarker for incipient AD.},

abstract = {Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings are a rich source of information about the neural dynamics underlying cognitive processes in the brain, with excellent temporal and good spatial resolution. In recent years there have been considerable advances in MEG hardware developments and methods. Sophisticated analysis techniques are now routinely applied and continuously improved, leading to fascinating insights into the intricate dynamics of neural processes. However, the rapidly increasing level of complexity of the different steps in a MEG study make it difficult for novices, and sometimes even for experts, to stay aware of possible limitations and caveats. Furthermore, the complexity of MEG data acquisition and data analysis requires special attention when describing MEG studies in publications, in order to facilitate interpretation and reproduction of the results. This manuscript aims at making recommendations for a number of important data acquisition and data analysis steps and suggests details that should be specified in manuscripts reporting MEG studies. These recommendations will hopefully serve as guidelines that help to strengthen the position of the MEG research community within the field of neuroscience, and may foster discussion in order to further enhance the quality and impact of MEG research.},

abstract = {In this study we examined changes in the large-scale structure of resting-state brain networks in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with non-demented controls, using concepts from graph theory. Magneto-encephalograms (MEG) were recorded in 18 Alzheimer's disease patients and 18 non-demented control subjects in a no-task, eyes-closed condition. For the main frequency bands, synchronization between all pairs of MEG channels was assessed using a phase lag index (PLI, a synchronization measure insensitive to volume conduction). PLI-weighted connectivity networks were calculated, and characterized by a mean clustering coefficient and path length. Alzheimer's disease patients showed a decrease of mean PLI in the lower alpha and beta band. In the lower alpha band, the clustering coefficient and path length were both decreased in Alzheimer's disease patients. Network changes in the lower alpha band were better explained by a 'Targeted Attack' model than by a 'Random Failure' model. Thus, Alzheimer's disease patients display a loss of resting-state functional connectivity in lower alpha and beta bands even when a measure insensitive to volume conduction effects is used. Moreover, the large-scale structure of lower alpha band functional networks in Alzheimer's disease is more random. The modelling results suggest that highly connected neural network 'hubs' may be especially at risk in Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {The analysis of the interdependence between time series has become an important field of research in the last years, mainly as a result of advances in the characterization of dynamical systems from the signals they produce, the introduction of concepts such as generalized and phase synchronization and the application of information theory to time series analysis. In neurophysiology, different analytical tools stemming from these concepts have added to the 'traditional' set of linear methods, which includes the cross-correlation and the coherency function in the time and frequency domain, respectively, or more elaborated tools such as Granger Causality.This increase in the number of approaches to tackle the existence of functional (FC) or effective connectivity (EC) between two (or among many) neural networks, along with the mathematical complexity of the corresponding time series analysis tools, makes it desirable to arrange them into a unified-easy-to-use software package. The goal is to allow neuroscientists, neurophysiologists and researchers from related fields to easily access and make use of these analysis methods from a single integrated toolbox.Here we present HERMES ( http://hermes.ctb.upm.es ), a toolbox for the Matlab® environment (The Mathworks, Inc), which is designed to study functional and effective brain connectivity from neurophysiological data such as multivariate EEG and/or MEG records. It includes also visualization tools and statistical methods to address the problem of multiple comparisons. We believe that this toolbox will be very helpful to all the researchers working in the emerging field of brain connectivity analysis.},

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a relatively new functional neuroimaging technique, which allows the simultaneous recording of the brain's magnetic activity from large arrays of sensors covering the whole head. MEG studies in PD and AD have identified characteristic patterns of abnormal oscillatory activity in different frequency bands. Furthermore, MEG studies aimed at the characterization of distributed functional networks have demonstrated distinct patterns of abnormal connectivity in demented and non-demented PD, as well as in AD. In PD abnormal oscillatory activity and disturbed connectivity may respond differently to dopaminergic treatment. Further studies in this field could benefit from new technological developments such as ultra low field MRI and from the application of a well-defined theoretical framework such as graph theory to the study of disturbed brain networks.},

In this study we combine magneto-encephalography (MEG) and network analysis to investigate the role of functional sub-networks (modules) in the brain with regard to cognitive failure in Alzheimer's disease. Whole-head resting-state (MEG) was performed in 18 Alzheimer patients (age 67 ± 9, 6 females, MMSE 23 ± 5) and 18 healthy controls (age 66 ± 9, 11 females, MMSE 29 ± 1). We constructed functional brain networks based on interregional synchronization measurements, and performed graph theoretical analysis with a focus on modular organization. The overall modular strength and the number of modules changed significantly in Alzheimer patients. The parietal cortex was the most highly connected network area, but showed the strongest intramodular losses. Nonetheless, weakening of intermodular connectivity was even more outspoken, and more strongly related to cognitive impairment. The results of this study demonstrate that particularly the loss of communication between different functional brain regions reflects cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. These findings imply the relevance of regarding dementia as a functional network disorder.},

These categories are informed by knowledge of the way that objects co-occur in natural scenes. How does the human brain aggregate information about objects to represent scene categories? To explore this issue, we used statistical learning methods to learn categories that objectively capture the co-occurrence statistics of objects in a large collection of natural scenes. Using the learned categories, we modeled fMRI brain signals evoked in human subjects when viewing images of scenes. We find that evoked activity across much of anterior visual cortex is explained by the learned categories. Furthermore, a decoder based on these scene categories accurately predicts the categories and objects comprising novel scenes from brain activity evoked by those scenes. These results suggest that the human brain represents scene categories that capture the co-occurrence statistics of objects in the world.},

MEG recordings from 20 AD patients and 21 controls were analyzed by means of two spectral [median frequency (MF) and spectral entropy (SpecEn)] and two nonlinear parameters [approximate entropy (ApEn) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC)]. In the AD diagnosis, the highest accuracy of 75.6\% (80\% sensitivity, 71.4\% specificity) was obtained with the MF according to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. Moreover, we wanted to assess whether these spectral and nonlinear analyses could provide complementary information to improve the AD diagnosis. After a forward stepwise LDA with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, one spectral (MF) and one nonlinear parameter (ApEn) were automatically selected. In this model, an accuracy of 80.5\% (80.0\% sensitivity, 81.0\% specificity) was achieved. We conclude that spectral and nonlinear analyses from spontaneous MEG activity could be complementary methods to help in AD detection.},

We investigated topographic characteristics of disturbed resting-state networks in Alzheimer's disease patients in different frequency bands. Whole-head 151-channel MEG was recorded in 18 Alzheimer patients (mean age 72.1 years, SD 5.6; 11 males) and 18 healthy controls (mean age 69.1 years, SD 6.8; 7 males) during a no-task eyes-closed resting state. Pair-wise interdependencies of MEG signals were computed in six frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta and gamma) with the synchronization likelihood (a nonlinear measure) and coherence and grouped into long distance (intra- and interhemispheric) and short distance interactions. In the alpha1 and beta band, Alzheimer patients showed a loss of long distance intrahemispheric interactions, with a focus on left fronto-temporal/parietal connections. Functional connectivity was increased in Alzheimer patients locally in the theta band (centro-parietal regions) and the beta and gamma band (occipito-parietal regions). In the Alzheimer group, positive correlations were found between alpha1, alpha2 and beta band synchronization likelihood and MMSE score. Resting-state functional connectivity in Alzheimer's disease is characterized by specific changes of long and short distance interactions in the theta, alpha1, beta and gamma bands. These changes may reflect loss of anatomical connections and/or reduced central cholinergic activity and could underlie part of the cognitive impairment.},

abstract = {Resting-state or intrinsic connectivity network functional magnetic resonance imaging provides a new tool for mapping large-scale neural network function and dysfunction. Recently, we showed that behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease cause atrophy within two major networks, an anterior 'Salience Network' (atrophied in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia) and a posterior 'Default Mode Network' (atrophied in Alzheimer's disease). These networks exhibit an anti-correlated relationship with each other in the healthy brain. The two diseases also feature divergent symptom-deficit profiles, with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia undermining social-emotional function and preserving or enhancing visuospatial skills, and Alzheimer's disease showing the inverse pattern. We hypothesized that these disorders would exert opposing connectivity effects within the Salience Network (disrupted in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia but enhanced in Alzheimer's disease) and the Default Mode Network (disrupted in Alzheimer's disease but enhanced in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia). With task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested these ideas in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and healthy age-matched controls (n = 12 per group), using independent component analyses to generate group-level network contrasts. As predicted, behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia attenuated Salience Network connectivity, most notably in frontoinsular, cingulate, striatal, thalamic and brainstem nodes, but enhanced connectivity within the Default Mode Network. Alzheimer's disease, in contrast, reduced Default Mode Network connectivity to posterior hippocampus, medial cingulo-parieto-occipital regions and the dorsal raphe nucleus, but intensified Salience Network connectivity. Specific regions of connectivity disruption within each targeted network predicted intrinsic connectivity enhancement within the reciprocal network. In behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, clinical severity correlated with loss of right frontoinsular Salience Network connectivity and with biparietal Default Mode Network connectivity enhancement. Based on these results, we explored whether a combined index of Salience Network and Default Mode Network connectivity might discriminate between the three groups. Linear discriminant analysis achieved 92\% clinical classification accuracy, including 100\% separation of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Patients whose clinical diagnoses were supported by molecular imaging, genetics, or pathology showed 100\% separation using this method, including four diagnostically equivocal 'test' patients not used to train the algorithm. Overall, the findings suggest that behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease lead to divergent network connectivity patterns, consistent with known reciprocal network interactions and the strength and deficit profiles of the two disorders. Further developed, intrinsic connectivity network signatures may provide simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive biomarkers for dementia differential diagnosis and disease monitoring.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. As an incurable, progressive, and neurodegenerative disease, it causes cognitive and memory deficits. However, the biological mechanisms underlying the disease are not thoroughly understood. In recent years, non-invasive neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques [e.g., structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI, functional MRI, and EEG/MEG] and graph theory based network analysis have provided a new perspective on structural and functional connectivity patterns of the human brain (i.e., the human connectome) in health and disease. Using these powerful approaches, several recent studies of patients with AD exhibited abnormal topological organization in both global and regional properties of neuronal networks, indicating that AD not only affects specific brain regions, but also alters the structural and functional associations between distinct brain regions. Specifically, disruptive organization in the whole-brain networks in AD is involved in the loss of small-world characters and the re-organization of hub distributions. These aberrant neuronal connectivity patterns were associated with cognitive deficits in patients with AD, even with genetic factors in healthy aging. These studies provide empirical evidence to support the existence of an aberrant connectome of AD. In this review we will summarize recent advances discovered in large-scale brain network studies of AD, mainly focusing on graph theoretical analysis of brain connectivity abnormalities. These studies provide novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD and could be helpful in developing imaging biomarkers for disease diagnosis and monitoring.},

The "amyloid cascade hypothesis" posits that cerebral amyloid sets neurotoxic events into motion that precipitate Alzheimer dementia (Hardy and Allsop, 1991). Yet, faithful recapitulation of all AD features in widely used transgenic (Tg) mice engineered to overproduce A$\beta$ peptides has been elusive. We have developed a Tg rat model (line TgF344-AD) expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and presenilin 1 (PS1$\Delta$E9) genes, each independent causes of early-onset familial AD. TgF344-AD rats manifest age-dependent cerebral amyloidosis that precedes tauopathy, gliosis, apoptotic loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and cognitive disturbance. These results demonstrate progressive neurodegeneration of the Alzheimer type in these animals. The TgF344-AD rat fills a critical need for a next-generation animal model to enable basic and translational AD research.},

In this BTBI, an "encoder" rat performed sensorimotor tasks that required it to select from two choices of tactile or visual stimuli. While the encoder rat performed the task, samples of its cortical activity were transmitted to matching cortical areas of a "decoder" rat using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). The decoder rat learned to make similar behavioral selections, guided solely by the information provided by the encoder rat's brain. These results demonstrated that a complex system was formed by coupling the animals' brains, suggesting that BTBIs can enable dyads or networks of animal's brains to exchange, process, and store information and, hence, serve as the basis for studies of novel types of social interaction and for biological computing devices.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The main obstacle in interpreting EEG/MEG data in terms of brain connectivity is the fact that because of volume conduction, the activity of a single brain source can be observed in many channels. Here, we present an approach which is insensitive to false connectivity arising from volume conduction. METHODS: We show that the (complex) coherency of non-interacting sources is necessarily real and, hence, the imaginary part of coherency provides an excellent candidate to study brain interactions. Although the usual magnitude and phase of coherency contain the same information as the real and imaginary parts, we argue that the Cartesian representation is far superior for studying brain interactions. The method is demonstrated for EEG measurements of voluntary finger movement. RESULTS: We found: (a) from 5 s before to movement onset a relatively weak interaction around 20 Hz between left and right motor areas where the contralateral side leads the ipsilateral side; and (b) approximately 2-4 s after movement, a stronger interaction also at 20 Hz in the opposite direction. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to reliably detect brain interaction during movement from EEG data. SIGNIFICANCE: The method allows unambiguous detection of brain interaction from rhythmic EEG/MEG data.},

abstract = {Brain connectivity studies have revealed that highly connected 'hub' regions are particularly vulnerable to Alzheimer pathology: they show marked amyloid-$\beta$ deposition at an early stage. Recently, excessive local neuronal activity has been shown to increase amyloid deposition. In this study we use a computational model to test the hypothesis that hub regions possess the highest level of activity and that hub vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease is due to this feature. Cortical brain regions were modeled as neural masses, each describing the average activity (spike density and spectral power) of a large number of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The large-scale network consisted of 78 neural masses, connected according to a human DTI-based cortical topology. Spike density and spectral power were positively correlated with structural and functional node degrees, confirming the high activity of hub regions, also offering a possible explanation for high resting state Default Mode Network activity. 'Activity dependent degeneration' (ADD) was simulated by lowering synaptic strength as a function of the spike density of the main excitatory neurons, and compared to random degeneration. Resulting structural and functional network changes were assessed with graph theoretical analysis. Effects of ADD included oscillatory slowing, loss of spectral power and long-range synchronization, hub vulnerability, and disrupted functional network topology. Observed transient increases in spike density and functional connectivity match reports in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients, and may not be compensatory but pathological. In conclusion, the assumption of excessive neuronal activity leading to degeneration provides a possible explanation for hub vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease, supported by the observed relation between connectivity and activity and the reproduction of several neurophysiologic hallmarks. The insight that neuronal activity might play a causal role in Alzheimer's disease can have implications for early detection and interventional strategies.},

abstract = {This article presents, for the first time, a practical method for the direct quantification of frequency-specific synchronization (i.e., transient phase-locking) between two neuroelectric signals. The motivation for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics (PLS), measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals with a reasonable time-resolution (<100 ms). Unlike the more traditional method of spectral coherence, PLS separates the phase and amplitude components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations, PLS uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on the nature of the experimental data. We also apply PLS to investigate intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction. We discuss ways to separate such conduction effects from true signal synchrony.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To use large-scale network (LSN) analysis to classify subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD), those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and cognitively normal (CN) subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted with institutional review board approval and was in compliance with HIPAA regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to acquire the voxelwise time series in 55 subjects with clinically diagnosed AD (n = 20), aMCI (n =15), and normal cognitive function (n = 20). The brains were divided into 116 regions of interest (ROIs). The Pearson product moment correlation coefficients of pairwise ROIs were used to classify these subjects. Error estimation of the classifications was performed with the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between changes in network connectivity strengths and behavioral scores. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) yielded 87\% classification power, 85\% sensitivity, and 80\% specificity between the AD group and the non-AD group (subjects with aMCI and CN subjects) in the first-step classification. For differentiation between subjects with aMCI and CN subjects, AUC was 95\%; sensitivity, 93\%; and specificity, 90\%. The decreased network indexes were significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination score in all tested subjects. Similarly, changes in network indexes significantly correlated with Rey Auditory Verbal Leaning Test delayed recall scores in subjects with aMCI and CN subjects. CONCLUSION: LSN analysis revealed that interconnectivity patterns of brain regions can be used to classify subjects with AD, those with aMCI, and CN subjects. In addition, the altered connectivity networks were significantly correlated with the results of cognitive tests.},

abstract = {A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain, arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or OEF. The OEF is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean hemisphere OEF were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission tomography and functional MRI. These decreases suggest the existence of an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be a transitional stage between aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether MCI represents early-stage AD by examining its natural history and neuropathologic basis. DESIGN: A prospective clinical and psychometric study of community-living elderly volunteers, both nondemented and minimally cognitively impaired, followed up for up to 9.5 years. Neuropathologic examinations were performed on participants who had undergone autopsy. SETTING: An AD research center. PARTICIPANTS: All participants enrolled between July 1990 and June 1997 with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores of 0 (cognitively healthy; n = 177; mean age, 78.9 years) or 0.5 (equivalent to MCI; n = 277; mean age, 76.9 years). Based on the degree of clinical confidence that MCI represented dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), 3 subgroups of individuals with CDR scores of 0.5 were identified: CDR 0.5/DAT, CDR 0.5/incipient DAT, and CDR 0.5/uncertain dementia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Progression to the stage of CDR 1, which characterizes mild definite DAT. RESULTS: Survival analysis showed that 100\% of CDR 0.5/DAT participants progressed to greater dementia severity over a 9.5-year period. At 5 years, rates of progression to a score of CDR 1 (or greater) for DAT were 60.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 50.2\%-70.8\%) for the CDR 0.5/DAT group, 35.7\% (95\% CI, 21.0\%-50.3\%) for the CDR 0.5/incipient DAT group, 19.9\% (95\% CI, 8.0\%-31.8\%) for the CDR 0.5/uncertain dementia group, and 6.8\% (95\% CI, 2.2\%-11.3\%) for CDR 0/controls. Progression to greater dementia severity correlated with degree of cognitive impairment at baseline. Twenty-four of the 25 participants with scores of CDR 0.5 had a neuropathologic dementing disorder, which was AD in 21 (84\%). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals currently characterized as having MCI progress steadily to greater stages of dementia severity at rates dependent on the level of cognitive impairment at entry and they almost always have the neuropathologic features of AD. We conclude that MCI generally represents early-stage AD.},

EEG/MEG signals can play an important role in providing measures of functional and effective connectivity in the brain. After a brief description of the foundations and basic methodological aspects of EEG/MEG signals, the relevance of the signals to obtain novel insights into the neuronal mechanisms underlying cognitive processes is surveyed, with emphasis on neuronal oscillations (ultra-slow, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and HFOs) and combinations of oscillations. Three main functional roles of brain oscillations are put in evidence: (1) coding specific information, (2) setting and modulating brain attentional states, and (3) assuring the communication between neuronal populations such that specific dynamic workspaces may be created. The latter form the material core of cognitive functions.},

abstract = {Neuronal gamma-band (30-100 Hz) synchronization subserves fundamental functions in neuronal processing. However, different experimental approaches differ widely in their success in finding gamma-band activity. We aimed at linking animal and human studies of gamma-band activity and at preparing optimized methods for an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms and functions of gamma-band activity and gamma-band coherence in humans. In the first step described here, we maximized the signal-to-noise ratio with which we can observe visually induced gamma-band activity in human magnetoencephalographic recordings. We used a stimulus and task design that evoked strong gamma-band activity in animals and combined it with multi-taper methods for spectral analysis and adaptive spatial filtering for source analysis. With this approach, we found human visual gamma-band activity very reliably across subjects and across multiple recording sessions of a given subject. While increases in gamma-band activity are typically accompanied by decreases in alpha- and beta-band activity, the gamma-band enhancement was often the spectral component with the highest signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, some subjects demonstrated two clearly separate visually induced gamma bands, one around 40 Hz and another between 70 and 80 Hz. Gamma-band activity was sustained for the entire stimulation period, which was up to 3 s. The sources of gamma-band activity were in the calcarine sulcus in all subjects. The results localize human visual gamma-band activity in frequency, time and space and the described methods allow its further investigation with great sensitivity.},

@article{Vinck2011,
abstract = {Phase-synchronization is a manifestation of interaction between neuronal groups measurable from LFP, EEG or MEG signals, however, volume conduction can cause the coherence and the phase locking value to spuriously increase. It has been shown that the imaginary component of the coherency (ImC) cannot be spuriously increased by volume-conduction of independent sources. Recently, it was proposed that the phase lag index (PLI), which estimates to what extent the phase leads and lags between signals from two sensors are nonequiprobable, improves on the ImC. Compared to ImC, PLI has the advantage of being less influenced by phase delays. However, sensitivity to volume-conduction and noise, and capacity to detect changes in phase-synchronization, is hindered by the discontinuity of the PLI, as small perturbations turn phase lags into leads and vice versa. To solve this problem, we introduce a related index, namely the weighted phase lag index (WPLI). Differently from PLI, in WPLI the contribution of the observed phase leads and lags is weighted by the magnitude of the imaginary component of the cross-spectrum. We demonstrate two advantages of the WPLI over the PLI, in terms of reduced sensitivity to additional, uncorrelated noise sources and increased statistical power to detect changes in phase-synchronization. Another factor that can affect phase-synchronization indices is sample-size bias. We show that, when directly estimated, both PLI and the magnitude of the ImC have typically positively biased estimators. To solve this problem, we develop an unbiased estimator of the squared PLI, and a debiased estimator of the squared WPLI.},

The key idea is that the results of tractography in the neighbourhood of an ambiguous local diffusion profile can help to infer the local fibre directions.

In this chapter we first review the different techniques used in the field of BMI, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and chronic multielectrode recordings. In addition we review the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for noninvasive modulation of excitability in relatively focal cortical areas.

The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened an international workgroup to review the biomarker, epidemiological, and neuropsychological evidence, and to develop recommendations to determine the factors which best predict the risk of progression from "normal" cognition to mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. We propose a conceptual framework and operational research criteria, based on the prevailing scientific evidence to date, to test and refine these models with longitudinal clinical research studies. These recommendations are solely intended for research purposes and do not have any clinical implications at this time.

The techniques developed fall into the general category of multivariate time series analysis, and in particular we extensively use the multitaper framework of spectral analysis. We develop specific protocols for the analysis of fMRI, optical imaging, and MEG data, and illustrate the techniques by applications to real data sets generated by these imaging modalities. In general, the analysis protocols involve two distinct stages: "noise" characterization and suppression, and "signal" characterization and visualization. An important general conclusion of our study is the utility of a frequency-based representation, with short, moving analysis windows to account for nonstationarity in the data. Of particular note are 1) the development of a decomposition technique (space-frequency singular value decomposition) that is shown to be a useful means of characterizing the image data, and 2) the development of an algorithm, based on multitaper methods, for the removal of approximately periodic physiological artifacts arising from cardiac and respiratory sources.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been a shift in focus from the study of local, mostly task-related activation to the exploration of the organization and functioning of large-scale structural and functional complex brain networks. Progress in the interdisciplinary field of modern network science has introduced many new concepts, analytical tools and models which allow a systematic interpretation of multivariate data obtained from structural and functional MRI, EEG and MEG. However, progress in this field has been hampered by the absence of a simple, unbiased method to represent the essential features of brain networks, and to compare these across different conditions, behavioural states and neuropsychiatric/neurological diseases. One promising solution to this problem is to represent brain networks by a minimum spanning tree (MST), a unique acyclic subgraph that connects all nodes and maximizes a property of interest such as synchronization between brain areas. We explain how the global and local properties of an MST can be characterized. We then review early and more recent applications of the MST to EEG and MEG in epilepsy, development, schizophrenia, brain tumours, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, and show how MST characterization performs compared to more conventional graph analysis. Finally, we illustrate how MST characterization allows representation of observed brain networks in a space of all possible tree configurations and discuss how this may simplify the construction of simple generative models of normal and abnormal brain network organization.},

abstract = {Recently, brain connectivity networks have been used for classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal controls (NC). In typical connectivity-networks-based classification approaches, local measures of connectivity networks are first extracted from each region-of-interest as network features, which are then concatenated into a vector for subsequent feature selection and classification. However, some useful structural information of network, especially global topological information, may be lost in this type of approaches. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a connectivity-networks-based classification framework to identify accurately the MCI patients from NC. The core of the proposed method involves the use of a new graph-kernel-based approach to measure directly the topological similarity between connectivity networks. We evaluate our method on functional connectivity networks of 12 MCI and 25 NC subjects. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 91.9\%, a sensitivity of 100.0\%, a balanced accuracy of 94.0\%, and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94, demonstrating a great potential in MCI classification, based on connectivity networks. Further connectivity analysis indicates that the connectivity of the selected brain regions is different between MCI patients and NC, that is, MCI patients show reduced functional connectivity compared with NC, in line with the findings reported in the existing studies.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that can be clinically characterized by impaired memory and many other cognitive functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the impairment is accompanied by not only regional brain abnormalities but also changes in neuronal connectivity between anatomically distinct brain regions. Specifically, using neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques as well as advanced graph theory-based computational approaches, several recent studies have suggested that AD patients have disruptive neuronal integrity in large-scale structural and functional brain systems underlying high-level cognition, as demonstrated by a loss of small-world network characteristics. Small world is an attractive model for the description of complex brain networks because it can support both segregated and integrated information processing. The altered small-world organization thus reflects aberrant neuronal connectivity in the AD brain that is most likely to explain cognitive deficits caused by this disease. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in the brain network research on AD, focusing mainly on the large-scale structural and functional descriptions. The literature reviewed here suggests that AD patients are associated with integrative abnormalities in the distributed neuronal networks, which could provide new insights into the disease mechanism in AD and help us to uncover an imaging-based biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease.},

abstract = {EEG and MEG (magnetoencephalography) are widely used to study functional connectivity between different brain regions. We address the question whether such connectivity patterns display an optimal organization for information processing. MEG recordings of five healthy human subjects were converted to sparsely connected graphs (N=126; k=15) by applying a suitable threshold to the N * N matrix of synchronization strengths. For intermediate frequencies (8-30 Hz) the synchronization patterns were similar to those of an ordered graph with a consistent drop of synchronization strength as a function of distance. For low (<8 Hz) and high (>30 Hz) frequency bands the synchronization patterns displayed the features of a so-called 'small-world' network. This might reflect an optimal organization pattern for information processing, connecting any two brain area by only a small number of intermediate steps.},

abstract = {Het gedrag van agenten in commerciele computer games wordt bepaald door zogeheten game AI. Als game AI wordt uitgebreid met een adaptief mechaniscme, kan ze leren van de eigen fouten (zelf-correctie), en het gedrag van de agenten aanpassen aan ongewone situaties (creativiteit). Een dergelijke game AI wordt adaptive game AI genoemd. Dit proefschrfit focust op het ontwerp en de implementatie van machine-learning technieken die succesvolle adaptive game AI mogelijk maken. Het eerste hoofdstuk geeft een motivatie voor het onderzoek, en formuleert een probleemstelling en vier onderzoeksvragen. Het onderzoek wordt sterk gemotiveerd door een gebrek aan raffinement bij de game AI van moderne games. Terwijl de audiovisuele kwaliteiten van games de laatste jaren met sprongen vooruit zijn gegaan, hebben professionele game-ontwikkelaars de game AI grotendeels genegeerd. Game-ontwikkelaars trachten bij spelers de beleving op te roepen dat de wereld voorgesteld in een game werkelijkheid is (dit wordt aangeduid met de term 'immersie'). Deze beveling wordt meestel teniet gedaan door het inferieure gedrag van de computergestuurde agenten. Adaptive game AI heeft de mogelijkheid de tijdsduur te verlengen dat een game uitdagend blijft voor een menselijke speler. Daarnaast kan ze de moeilijkheidsgraad van een game automatisch aanpassen aan de speelsterkte van de menselijke speler. Implementatie van deze eigenschappen kan ervoor zorgen dat adaptive game AI het gevoel van immersie bij de menselijke speler versterkt.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of small-world and scale-free networks the study of complex systems from a network perspective has taken an enormous flight. In recent years many important properties of complex networks have been delineated. In particular, significant progress has been made in understanding the relationship between the structural properties of networks and the nature of dynamics taking place on these networks. For instance, the 'synchronizability' of complex networks of coupled oscillators can be determined by graph spectral analysis. These developments in the theory of complex networks have inspired new applications in the field of neuroscience. Graph analysis has been used in the study of models of neural networks, anatomical connectivity, and functional connectivity based upon fMRI, EEG and MEG. These studies suggest that the human brain can be modelled as a complex network, and may have a small-world structure both at the level of anatomical as well as functional connectivity. This small-world structure is hypothesized to reflect an optimal situation associated with rapid synchronization and information transfer, minimal wiring costs, as well as a balance between local processing and global integration. The topological structure of functional networks is probably restrained by genetic and anatomical factors, but can be modified during tasks. There is also increasing evidence that various types of brain disease such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, brain tumours and epilepsy may be associated with deviations of the functional network topology from the optimal small-world pattern.},

abstract = {The interrelationships between pathological processes and emerging clinical phenotypes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are important yet complicated to study, because the brain is a complex network where local disruptions can have widespread effects. Recently, properties in brain networks obtained with neuroimaging techniques have been studied in AD with tools from graph theory. However, the interpretation of graph alterations remains unclear, because the definition of connectivity depends on the imaging modality used. Here we examined which graph properties have been consistently reported to be disturbed in AD studies, using a heuristically defined "graph space" to investigate which theoretical models can best explain graph alterations in AD. Findings from structural and functional graphs point to a loss of highly connected areas in AD. However, studies showed considerable variability in reported group differences of most graph properties. This suggests that brain graphs might not be isometric, which complicates the interpretation of graph measurements. We highlight confounding factors such as differences in graph construction methods and provide recommendations for future research.},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, are associated with changes in multiple neuroimaging and biological measures. These may provide complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. We present a multi-modality classification framework in which manifolds are constructed based on pairwise similarity measures derived from random forest classifiers. Similarities from multiple modalities are combined to generate an embedding that simultaneously encodes information about all the available features. Multi-modality classification is then performed using coordinates from this joint embedding. We evaluate the proposed framework by application to neuroimaging and biological data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Features include regional MRI volumes, voxel-based FDG-PET signal intensities, CSF biomarker measures, and categorical genetic information. Classification based on the joint embedding constructed using information from all four modalities out-performs the classification based on any individual modality for comparisons between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, as well as between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. Based on the joint embedding, we achieve classification accuracies of 89\% between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, and 75\% between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. These results are comparable with those reported in other recent studies using multi-kernel learning. Random forests provide consistent pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities, thus facilitating the combination of different types of feature data. We demonstrate this by application to data in which the number of features differs by several orders of magnitude between modalities. Random forest classifiers extend naturally to multi-class problems, and the framework described here could be applied to distinguish between multiple patient groups in the future.},

abstract = {The complexity of the human brain's activity and connectivity varies over temporal scales and is altered in disease states such as schizophrenia. Using a multi-level analysis of spontaneous low-frequency fMRI data stretching from the activity of individual brain regions to the coordinated connectivity pattern of the whole brain, we investigate the role of brain signal complexity in schizophrenia. Specifically, we quantitatively characterize the univariate wavelet entropy of regional activity, the bivariate pairwise functional connectivity between regions, and the multivariate network organization of connectivity patterns. Our results indicate that univariate measures of complexity are less sensitive to disease state than higher level bivariate and multivariate measures. While wavelet entropy is unaffected by disease state, the magnitude of pairwise functional connectivity is significantly decreased in schizophrenia and the variance is increased. Furthermore, by considering the network structure as a function of correlation strength, we find that network organization specifically of weak connections is strongly correlated with attention, memory, and negative symptom scores and displays potential as a clinical biomarker, providing up to 75\% classification accuracy and 85\% sensitivity. We also develop a general statistical framework for the testing of group differences in network properties, which is broadly applicable to studies where changes in network organization are crucial to the understanding of brain function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our goal was to forecast the global burden of Alzheimer's disease and evaluate the potential impact of interventions that delay disease onset or progression. METHODS: A stochastic, multistate model was used in conjunction with United Nations worldwide population forecasts and data from epidemiological studies of the risks of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: In 2006, the worldwide prevalence of Alzheimer's disease was 26.6 million. By 2050, the prevalence will quadruple, by which time 1 in 85 persons worldwide will be living with the disease. We estimate about 43\% of prevalent cases need a high level of care, equivalent to that of a nursing home. If interventions could delay both disease onset and progression by a modest 1 year, there would be nearly 9.2 million fewer cases of the disease in 2050, with nearly the entire decline attributable to decreases in persons needing a high level of care. CONCLUSIONS: We face a looming global epidemic of Alzheimer's disease as the world's population ages. Modest advances in therapeutic and preventive strategies that lead to even small delays in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease can significantly reduce the global burden of this disease.},

abstract = {We propose and study a set of algorithms for discovering community structure in networks -- natural divisions of network nodes into densely connected subgroups. Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using one of a number of possible "betweenness" measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

abstract = {The early detection of subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for effective appliance of treatment strategies. Here we explored the ability of a multitude of linear and non-linear classification algorithms to discriminate between the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of patients with varying degree of AD and their age-matched control subjects. Absolute and relative spectral power, distribution of spectral power, and measures of spatial synchronization were calculated from recordings of resting eyes-closed continuous EEGs of 45 healthy controls, 116 patients with mild AD and 81 patients with moderate AD, recruited in two different centers (Stockholm, New York). The applied classification algorithms were: principal component linear discriminant analysis (PC LDA), partial least squares LDA (PLS LDA), principal component logistic regression (PC LR), partial least squares logistic regression (PLS LR), bagging, random forest, support vector machines (SVM) and feed-forward neural network. Based on 10-fold cross-validation runs it could be demonstrated that even tough modern computer-intensive classification algorithms such as random forests, SVM and neural networks show a slight superiority, more classical classification algorithms performed nearly equally well. Using random forests classification a considerable sensitivity of up to 85\% and a specificity of 78\%, respectively for the test of even only mild AD patients has been reached, whereas for the comparison of moderate AD vs. controls, using SVM and neural networks, values of 89\% and 88\% for sensitivity and specificity were achieved. Such a remarkable performance proves the value of these classification algorithms for clinical diagnostics.},

These firing patterns differ from the single-peaked fields of hippocampal place cells, in that they have well-defined geometries and extend throughout the available space. Such discharge properties could contribute to a metric representation of space. Both functional and anatomical evidence point to principal cell diversity, modularity and columnar organization, but linking entorhinal anatomy and physiology remains challenging. Layer 2 microcircuits consist of pyramidal neurons and a stellate cell network, which lacks recurrent excitation and is coupled by disynaptic inhibition. Intracellular recordings showed that periodic, grid-like firing emerges from depolarization ramps, whereas theta-oscillations determine spike timing. Interference with various inputs to entorhinal cortex abolishes grid activity, often without concomitant loss of hippocampal place activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To address the problem of volume conduction and active reference electrodes in the assessment of functional connectivity, we propose a novel measure to quantify phase synchronization, the phase lag index (PLI), and compare its performance to the well-known phase coherence (PC), and to the imaginary component of coherency (IC). METHODS: The PLI is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of phase differences between two signals. The performance of PLI, PC, and IC was examined in (i) a model of 64 globally coupled oscillators, (ii) an EEG with an absence seizure, (iii) an EEG data set of 15 Alzheimer patients and 13 control subjects, and (iv) two MEG data sets. RESULTS: PLI and PC were more sensitive than IC to increasing levels of true synchronization in the model. PC and IC were influenced stronger than PLI by spurious correlations because of common sources. All measures detected changes in synchronization during the absence seizure. In contrast to PC, PLI and IC were barely changed by the choice of different montages. PLI and IC were superior to PC in detecting changes in beta band connectivity in AD patients. Finally, PLI and IC revealed a different spatial pattern of functional connectivity in MEG data than PC. CONCLUSION: The PLI performed at least as well as the PC in detecting true changes in synchronization in model and real data but, at the same token and like-wise the IC, it was much less affected by the influence of common sources and active reference electrodes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Important functional connections within the default mode network (DMN) are disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD), likely from amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque-associated neuronal toxicity. Here, we sought to determine if pathological effects of Abeta amyloid plaques could be seen, even in the absence of a task, by examining functional connectivity in cognitively normal participants with and without preclinical amyloid deposition. METHODS: Participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 35) were compared with 68 cognitively normal participants who were further subdivided by positron emission tomography (PET) Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB) imaging into those without evidence of brain amyloid (PIB-) and those with brain amyloid (PIB+) deposition. RESULTS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) demonstrated that, compared with the PIB- group, the PIB+ group differed significantly in functional connectivity of the precuneus to hippocampus, parahippocampus, anterior cingulate, dorsal cingulate, gyrus rectus, superior precuneus, and visual cortex. These differences were in the same regions and in the same direction as differences found in the AD group. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, before any manifestations of cognitive or behavioral changes, there were differences in resting state connectivity in cognitively normal subjects with brain amyloid deposition, suggesting that early manifestation of Abeta toxicity can be detected using resting state fMRI.},

@article{Zhou2011,
abstract = {Owning to its clinical accessibility, T1-weighted MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) has been extensively studied in the past decades for prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The volumes of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the most commonly used measurements, resulting in many successful applications. It has been widely observed that disease-induced structural changes may not occur at isolated spots, but in several inter-related regions. Therefore, for better characterization of brain pathology, we propose in this paper a means to extract inter-regional correlation based features from local volumetric measurements. Specifically, our approach involves constructing an anatomical brain network for each subject, with each node representing a Region of Interest (ROI) and each edge representing Pearson correlation of tissue volumetric measurements between ROI pairs. As second order volumetric measurements, network features are more descriptive but also more sensitive to noise. To overcome this limitation, a hierarchy of ROIs is used to suppress noise at different scales. Pairwise interactions are considered not only for ROIs with the same scale in the same layer of the hierarchy, but also for ROIs across different scales in different layers. To address the high dimensionality problem resulting from the large number of network features, a supervised dimensionality reduction method is further employed to embed a selected subset of features into a low dimensional feature space, while at the same time preserving discriminative information. We demonstrate with experimental results the efficacy of this embedding strategy in comparison with some other commonly used approaches. In addition, although the proposed method can be easily generalized to incorporate other metrics of regional similarities, the benefits of using Pearson correlation in our application are reinforced by the experimental results. Without requiring new sources of information, our proposed approach improves the accuracy of MCI prediction from 80.83\% (of conventional volumetric features) to 84.35\% (of hierarchical network features), evaluated using data sets randomly drawn from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset.},

We introduce a machine learning method to boost power in clinical trials. We created a Support Vector Machine algorithm that combines brain imaging and other biomarkers to classify 737 Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) subjects as having Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or normal controls. We trained our classifiers based on example data including: MRI measures of hippocampal, ventricular, and temporal lobe volumes, a PET-FDG numerical summary, CSF biomarkers (t-tau, p-tau, and Abeta(42)), ApoE genotype, age, sex, and body mass index. MRI measures contributed most to Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification; PET-FDG and CSF biomarkers, particularly Abeta(42), contributed more to MCI classification. Using all biomarkers jointly, we used our classifier to select the one-third of the subjects most likely to decline. In this subsample, fewer than 40 AD and MCI subjects would be needed to detect a 25\% slowing in temporal lobe atrophy rates with 80\% power--a substantial boosting of power relative to standard imaging measures.},

MEG's are shown, simultaneously with the electroencephalogram (EEG), of the alpha rhythm of a normal subject and of the slow waves from an abnormal subject. The normal MEG shows the alpha rhythm, as does the EEG, when the subject's eyes are closed; however, this MEG also shows that higher detector sensitivity, by a factor of 3, would be necessary in order to clearly show the smaller brain events when the eyes are open. The abnormal MEG, including a measurenment of the direct-current component, suggests that the MEG may yield some information which is new and different from that provided by the EEG.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It remains controversial whether interictal spikes are a surrogate of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Electric source imaging (ESI) is an increasingly validated non-invasive approach for localising the epileptogenic focus in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy undergoing evaluation for surgery, using high-density scalp EEG and advanced source localisation algorithms that include the patient's own MRI. Here we investigate whether localisation of interictal spikes by ESI provides valuable information on the SOZ.

METHODS: In 38 patients with focal epilepsy who later underwent intracranial EEG monitoring, we performed ESI of interictal spikes recorded with 128-256-channel EEG. We measured the distance between the ESI maximum and the nearest intracranial electrodes in the SOZ and irritative zone (IZ, the source of interictal spikes). The resection of the region harbouring the ESI maximum was correlated to surgical outcome.

RESULTS: The median distance from the ESI maximum to the nearest electrode involved in the SOZ was 17 mm (IQR 8-27). The IZ and SOZ colocalised in most patients (median distance 0 mm, IQR 0-14), supporting the notion that localising interictal spikes is a valid surrogate for the SOZ. There was no difference in accuracy among patients with temporal or extratemporal epilepsy. In the 32 patients who underwent resective surgery, including the ESI maximum in the resection correlated with favourable outcome (p=0.03).

CONCLUSIONS: Localisation of interictal spikes provides an excellent estimate of the SOZ in the majority of patients. ESI should be taken into account for the management of patients undergoing intracranial recordings.},

However, brain networks or connectomes also have high topological efficiency, robustness, modularity and a 'rich club' of connector hubs. Many of these and other advantageous topological properties will probably entail a wiring-cost premium. We propose that brain organization is shaped by an economic trade-off between minimizing costs and allowing the emergence of adaptively valuable topological patterns of anatomical or functional connectivity between multiple neuronal populations. This process of negotiating, and re-negotiating, trade-offs between wiring cost and topological value continues over long (decades) and short (millisecond) timescales as brain networks evolve, grow and adapt to changing cognitive demands. An economical analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders highlights the vulnerability of the more costly elements of brain networks to pathological attack or abnormal development.},

abstract = {Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) experience a brain network breakdown, reflecting disconnection at both the structural and functional system level. Resting-state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI) studies demonstrated that the regional coherence of the fMRI signal is significantly altered in patients with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Diffusion tensor (DT) MRI has made it possible to track fiber bundle projections across the brain, revealing a substantially abnormal interplay of “critical” white matter tracts in these conditions. The observed agreement between the results of RS fMRI and DT MRI tractography studies in healthy individuals is encouraging and offers interesting hypotheses to be tested in patients with AD, a MCI, and other dementias in order to improve our understanding of their pathobiology in vivo. In this review,we describe the major findings obtained in AD using RS fMRI and DT MRI tractography, and discuss how the relationship between structure and function of the brain networks in AD may be better understood through the application of MR-based technology. This research endeavor holds a great promise in clarifying the mechanisms of cognitive decline in complex chronic neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {We have developed a method for automated probabilistic reconstruction of a set of major white-matter pathways from diffusion-weighted MR images. Our method is called TRACULA (TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy) and utilizes prior information on the anatomy of the pathways from a set of training subjects. By incorporating this prior knowledge in the reconstruction procedure, our method obviates the need for manual interaction with the tract solutions at a later stage and thus facilitates the application of tractography to large studies. In this paper we illustrate the application of the method on data from a schizophrenia study and investigate whether the inclusion of both patients and healthy subjects in the training set affects our ability to reconstruct the pathways reliably. We show that, since our method does not constrain the exact spatial location or shape of the pathways but only their trajectory relative to the surrounding anatomical structures, a set a of healthy training subjects can be used to reconstruct the pathways accurately in patients as well as in controls.},

@article{Tsiaras2011,
abstract = {The present study is a preliminary attempt to use graph theory for deriving distinct features of resting-state functional networks in young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Networks modeled neuromagnetic signal interactions between sensors using three alternative interdependence measures: (a) a non-linear measure of generalized synchronization (robust interdependence measure [RIM]), (b) mutual information (MI), and (c) partial directed coherence (PDC). To summarize the information contained in each network model we employed well-established global graph measures (average strength, assortativity, clustering, and efficiency) as well as graph measures (average strength of edges) tailored to specific hypotheses concerning the spatial distribution of abnormalities in connectivity among individuals with ASD. Graph measures then served as features in leave-one-out classification analyses contrasting control and ASD participants. We found that combinations of regionally constrained graph measures, derived from RIM, performed best, discriminating between the two groups with 93.75\% accuracy. Network visualization revealed that ASD participants displayed significantly reduced interdependence strength, both within bilateral frontal and temporal sensors, as well as between temporal sensors and the remaining recording sites, in agreement with previous studies of functional connectivity in this disorder.},

@article{Tabot2013,
abstract = {Our ability to manipulate objects dexterously relies fundamentally on sensory signals originating from the hand. To restore motor function with upper-limb neuroprostheses requires that somatosensory feedback be provided to the tetraplegic patient or amputee. Given the complexity of state-of-the-art prosthetic limbs and, thus, the huge state space they can traverse, it is desirable to minimize the need for the patient to learn associations between events impinging on the limb and arbitrary sensations. Accordingly, we have developed approaches to intuitively convey sensory information that is critical for object manipulation-information about contact location, pressure, and timing-through intracortical microstimulation of primary somatosensory cortex. In experiments with nonhuman primates, we show that we can elicit percepts that are projected to a localized patch of skin and that track the pressure exerted on the skin. In a real-time application, we demonstrate that animals can perform a tactile discrimination task equally well whether mechanical stimuli are delivered to their native fingers or to a prosthetic one. Finally, we propose that the timing of contact events can be signaled through phasic intracortical microstimulation at the onset and offset of object contact that mimics the ubiquitous on and off responses observed in primary somatosensory cortex to complement slowly varying pressure-related feedback. We anticipate that the proposed biomimetic feedback will considerably increase the dexterity and embodiment of upper-limb neuroprostheses and will constitute an important step in restoring touch to individuals who have lost it.},

In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic model of the functional brain connectivity network, the strong-edge model, which incorporates the temporal fluctuation of neurodynamics. We also introduce a systematic approach to identifying biomarkers based on network characteristics that quantitatively describe the organization of the brain network. The evaluation results of the proposed strong-edge network model is quite promising. The biomarkers derived from the strong-edge model have achieved much higher prediction accuracy of 89\% (ROCAUC: 0.96) in distinguishing depression subjects from healthy controls in comparison with the conventional network model (accuracy: 76\%, ROC-AUC: 0.87). These novel biomarkers have the high potential of being applied clinically in diagnosing neurological and psychiatric brain diseases with noninvasive neuroimaging technologies.},

abstract = {The assessment of resting-state functional connectivity has become an important tool in studying brain disease mechanisms. Here we use magnetoencephalography to longitudinally evaluate functional connectivity changes in relation to clinical measures of disease progression in Parkinson's disease (PD). Using a source-space based approach with detailed anatomical mapping, functional connectivity was assessed for temporal, prefrontal and high order sensory association areas known to show neuropathological changes in early clinical disease stages. At baseline, early stage, untreated PD patients (n = 12) had lower parahippocampal and temporal delta band connectivity and higher temporal alpha1 band connectivity compared to controls. Longitudinal analyses over a 4-year period in a larger patient group (n = 43) revealed decreases in alpha1 and alpha2 band connectivity for multiple seed regions that were associated with motor or cognitive deterioration. In the earliest clinical stages of PD, delta and alpha1 band resting-state functional connectivity is altered in temporal cortical regions. With disease progression, a reversal of the initial changes in alpha1 and additional decreases in alpha2 band connectivity evolving in a more widespread cortical pattern. These changes in functional connectivity appear to reflect clinically relevant phenomena and therefore hold promise as a marker of disease progression, with potential predictive value for clinical outcome.},

abstract = {Alterations in interregional neural connectivity have been suggested as a signature of the pathobiology of autism. There have been many reports of functional and anatomical connectivity being altered while individuals with autism are engaged in complex cognitive and social tasks. Although disrupted instantaneous correlation between cortical regions observed from functional MRI is considered to be an explanatory model for autism, the causal influence of a brain area on another (effective connectivity) is a vital link missing in these studies. The current study focuses on addressing this in an fMRI study of Theory-of-Mind (ToM) in 15 high-functioning adolescents and adults with autism and 15 typically developing control participants. Participants viewed a series of comic strip vignettes in the MRI scanner and were asked to choose the most logical end to the story from three alternatives, separately for trials involving physical and intentional causality. The mean time series, extracted from 18 activated regions of interest, were processed using a multivariate autoregressive model (MVAR) to obtain the causality matrices for each of the 30 participants. These causal connectivity weights, along with assessment scores, functional connectivity values, and fractional anisotropy obtained from DTI data for each participant, were submitted to a recursive cluster elimination based support vector machine classifier to determine the accuracy with which the classifier can predict a novel participant's group membership (autism or control). We found a maximum classification accuracy of 95.9\% with 19 features which had the highest discriminative ability between the groups. All of the 19 features were effective connectivity paths, indicating that causal information may be critical in discriminating between autism and control groups. These effective connectivity paths were also found to be significantly greater in controls as compared to ASD participants and consisted predominantly of outputs from the fusiform face area and middle temporal gyrus indicating impaired connectivity in ASD participants, particularly in the social brain areas. These findings collectively point toward the fact that alterations in causal connectivity in the brain in ASD could serve as a potential non-invasive neuroimaging signature for autism.},

abstract = {Resting state functional connectivity of MEG data was studied in 29 children (9-10 years old). The weighted phase lag index (WPLI) was employed for estimating connectivity and compared to coherence. To further evaluate the network structure, a graph analysis based on WPLI was used to determine clustering coefficient (C) and betweenness centrality (BC) as local coefficients as well as the characteristic path length (L) as a parameter for global interconnectedness. The network's modular structure was also calculated to estimate functional segregation. A seed region was identified in the central occipital area based on the power distribution at the sensor level in the alpha band. WPLI reveals a specific connectivity map different from power and coherence. BC and modularity show a strong level of connectedness in the occipital area between lateral and central sensors. C shows different isolated areas of occipital sensors. Globally, a network with the shortest L is detected in the alpha band, consistently with the local results. Our results are in agreement with findings in adults, indicating a similar functional network in children at this age in the alpha band. The integrated use of WPLI and graph analysis can help to gain a better description of resting state networks.},

It has become clear that simple activation studies are no longer sufficient. There is an urgent need to understand the brain as a complex structural and functional network. Interest in brain network studies has increased strongly with the advent of modern network theory and increasingly powerful investigative techniques such as "high-density EEG", MEG, functional and structural MRI. Modern network studies of the brain have demonstrated that healthy brains self-organize towards so-called "small-world networks" characterized by a combination of dense local connectivity and critical long-distance connections. In addition, normal brain networks display hierarchical modularity, and a connectivity backbone that consists of interconnected hub nodes. This complex architecture is believed to arise under genetic control and to underlie cognition and intelligence. Optimal brain network organization becomes disrupted in neurological disease in characteristic ways. This review gives an overview of modern network theory and its applications to healthy brain function and neurological disease, in particular using techniques from clinical neurophysiology, such as EEG and MEG.},

abstract = {Complex functional brain networks are large networks of brain regions and functional brain connections. Statistical characterizations of these networks aim to quantify global and local properties of brain activity with a small number of network measures. Important functional network measures include measures of modularity (measures of the goodness with which a network is optimally partitioned into functional subgroups) and measures of centrality (measures of the functional influence of individual brain regions). Characterizations of functional networks are increasing in popularity, but are associated with several important methodological problems. These problems include the inability to characterize densely connected and weighted functional networks, the neglect of degenerate topologically distinct high-modularity partitions of these networks, and the absence of a network null model for testing hypotheses of association between observed nontrivial network properties and simple weighted connectivity properties. In this study we describe a set of methods to overcome these problems. Specifically, we generalize measures of modularity and centrality to fully connected and weighted complex networks, describe the detection of degenerate high-modularity partitions of these networks, and introduce a weighted-connectivity null model of these networks. We illustrate our methods by demonstrating degenerate high-modularity partitions and strong correlations between two complementary measures of centrality in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) networks from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, an open-access repository of resting-state functional MRI datasets. Our methods may allow more sound and reliable characterizations and comparisons of functional brain networks across conditions and subjects.},

abstract = {We studied cardiac contamination of magnetoencephalographic signals in eight healthy volunteers. The signals were recorded in a magnetically shielded room while the subject was sitting under a whole-scalp neuromagnetometer and were averaged time-locked to the R wave of the electrocardiogram. The maximum amplitude of the cardiac artifact varied between the subjects and was on average 130 fT/cm. The number of significantly contaminated channels was higher over the left than the right hemisphere. The electric and magnetic signals varied over time in the same way, implying that the artifacts are generated by cardiac currents, without any significant contribution from blood-flow-related pulsations or body movements. These artifacts may have a considerable effect on unaveraged data, i.e., recordings of spontaneous brain activity, and thus should be taken into account in the analysis.},

abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that allows its users to control external devices with brain activity. Although the proof-of-concept was given decades ago, the reliable translation of user intent into device control commands is still a major challenge. Success requires the effective interaction of two adaptive controllers: the user's brain, which produces brain activity that encodes intent, and the BCI system, which translates that activity into device control commands. In order to facilitate this interaction, many laboratories are exploring a variety of signal analysis techniques to improve the adaptation of the BCI system to the user. In the literature, many machine learning and pattern classification algorithms have been reported to give impressive results when applied to BCI data in offline analyses. However, it is more difficult to evaluate their relative value for actual online use. BCI data competitions have been organized to provide objective formal evaluations of alternative methods. Prompted by the great interest in the first two BCI Competitions, we organized the third BCI Competition to address several of the most difficult and important analysis problems in BCI research. The paper describes the data sets that were provided to the competitors and gives an overview of the results.},

abstract = {Recently, many researchers have used graph theory to study the aberrant brain structures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have made great progress. However, the characteristics of the cortical network in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are still largely unexplored. In this study, the gray matter volumes obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for all brain regions except the cerebellum were parcellated into 90 areas using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template to construct cortical networks for 98 normal controls (NCs), 113 MCIs and 91 ADs. The measurements of the network properties were calculated for each of the three groups respectively. We found that all three cortical networks exhibited small-world properties and those strong interhemispheric correlations existed between bilaterally homologous regions. Among the three cortical networks, we found the greatest clustering coefficient and the longest absolute path length in AD, which might indicate that the organization of the cortical network was the least optimal in AD. The small-world measures of the MCI network exhibited intermediate values. This finding is logical given that MCI is considered to be the transitional stage between normal aging and AD. Out of all the between-group differences in the clustering coefficient and absolute path length, only the differences between the AD and normal control groups were statistically significant. Compared with the normal controls, the MCI and AD groups retained their hub regions in the frontal lobe but showed a loss of hub regions in the temporal lobe. In addition, altered interregional correlations were detected in the parahippocampus gyrus, medial temporal lobe, cingulum, fusiform, medial frontal lobe, and orbital frontal gyrus in groups with MCI and AD. Similar to previous studies of functional connectivity, we also revealed increased interregional correlations within the local brain lobes and disrupted long distance interregional correlations in groups with MCI and AD.},

Topological and geometrical properties of these graphs can be measured and compared to random graphs and to graphs derived from other neuroscience data or other (nonneural) complex systems. Both structural and functional human brain graphs have consistently demonstrated key topological properties such as small-worldness, modularity, and heterogeneous degree distributions. Brain graphs are also physically embedded so as to nearly minimize wiring cost, a key geometric property. Here we offer a conceptual review and methodological guide to graphical analysis of human neuroimaging data, with an emphasis on some of the key assumptions, issues, and trade-offs facing the investigator.},

abstract = {Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) of the brain has the potential to elicit networks of functional connectivity and to reveal changes thereof in animal models of neurological disorders. In the present study, we investigate the contribution of physiological noise and its impact on assessment of functional connectivity in rs-fMRI of medetomidine sedated, spontaneously breathing rats at ultrahigh field of 11.7 Tesla. We employed gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) with repetition times of 3s and used simultaneous recordings of physiological parameters. A model of linear regression was applied to quantify the amount of BOLD fMRI signal fluctuations attributable to physiological sources. Our results indicate that physiological noise - mainly originating from the respiratory cycle -dominates the rs-fMRI time course in the form of spatially complex correlation patterns. As a consequence, these physiological fluctuations introduce severe artifacts into seed-based correlation maps and lead to misinterpretation of corresponding connectivity measures. We demonstrate that a scheme of motion correction and linear regression can significantly reduce physiological noise in the rs-fMRI time course, remove artifacts, and hence improve the reproducibility of functional connectivity assessment. In conclusion, physiological noise can severely compromise functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) of the rodent at high fields and must be carefully considered in design and interpretation of future studies. Motion correction should be considered the primary strategy for reduction of apparent motion related to respiratory fluctuations. Combined with subsequent regression of physiological confounders, this strategy has proven successful in reducing physiological noise and related artifacts affecting functional connectivity analysis. The proposed new and rigorous protocol now opens the potential of fcMRI to elicit the role of brain connectivity in pathological processes without concerns of confounding contributions from physiological noise.},

abstract = {Recent advances in signal analysis have engendered EEG with the status of a true brain mapping and brain imaging method capable of providing spatio-temporal information regarding brain (dys)function. Because of the increasing interest in the temporal dynamics of brain networks, and because of the straightforward compatibility of the EEG with other brain imaging techniques, EEG is increasingly used in the neuroimaging community. However, the full capability of EEG is highly underestimated. Many combined EEG-fMRI studies use the EEG only as a spike-counter or an oscilloscope. Many cognitive and clinical EEG studies use the EEG still in its traditional way and analyze grapho-elements at certain electrodes and latencies. We here show that this way of using the EEG is not only dangerous because it leads to misinterpretations, but it is also largely ignoring the spatial aspects of the signals. In fact, EEG primarily measures the electric potential field at the scalp surface in the same way as MEG measures the magnetic field. By properly sampling and correctly analyzing this electric field, EEG can provide reliable information about the neuronal activity in the brain and the temporal dynamics of this activity in the millisecond range. This review explains some of these analysis methods and illustrates their potential in clinical and experimental applications.},

abstract = {Hippocampal ripples, episodic high-frequency field-potential oscillations primarily occurring during sleep and calmness, have been described in mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys and humans, and so far they have been associated with retention of previously acquired awake experience. Although hippocampal ripples have been studied in detail using neurophysiological methods, the global effects of ripples on the entire brain remain elusive, primarily owing to a lack of methodologies permitting concurrent hippocampal recordings and whole-brain activity mapping. By combining electrophysiological recordings in hippocampus with ripple-triggered functional magnetic resonance imaging, here we show that most of the cerebral cortex is selectively activated during the ripples, whereas most diencephalic, midbrain and brainstem regions are strongly and consistently inhibited. Analysis of regional temporal response patterns indicates that thalamic activity suppression precedes the hippocampal population burst, which itself is temporally bounded by massive activations of association and primary cortical areas. These findings suggest that during off-line memory consolidation, synergistic thalamocortical activity may be orchestrating a privileged interaction state between hippocampus and cortex by silencing the output of subcortical centres involved in sensory processing or potentially mediating procedural learning. Such a mechanism would cause minimal interference, enabling consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory.},

The most important difference was the appearance of unilateral cortical components for the mouse resting state data compared to bilateral rat cortical networks. Furthermore, a higher number of components was needed for the ICA analysis to separate different cortical regions in mice as compared to rats.},

In this BTBI, an "encoder" rat performed sensorimotor tasks that required it to select from two choices of tactile or visual stimuli. While the encoder rat performed the task, samples of its cortical activity were transmitted to matching cortical areas of a "decoder" rat using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). The decoder rat learned to make similar behavioral selections, guided solely by the information provided by the encoder rat's brain. These results demonstrated that a complex system was formed by coupling the animals' brains, suggesting that BTBIs can enable dyads or networks of animal's brains to exchange, process, and store information and, hence, serve as the basis for studies of novel types of social interaction and for biological computing devices.},

abstract = {Sensory neuroprostheses show great potential for alleviating major sensory deficits. It is not known, however, whether such devices can augment the subject's normal perceptual range. Here we show that adult rats can learn to perceive otherwise invisible infrared light through a neuroprosthesis that couples the output of a head-mounted infrared sensor to their somatosensory cortex (S1) via intracortical microstimulation. Rats readily learn to use this new information source, and generate active exploratory strategies to discriminate among infrared signals in their environment. S1 neurons in these infrared-perceiving rats respond to both whisker deflection and intracortical microstimulation, suggesting that the infrared representation does not displace the original tactile representation. Hence, sensory cortical prostheses, in addition to restoring normal neurological functions, may serve to expand natural perceptual capabilities in mammals.},

abstract = {Since its initial conceptualisation, metaplasticity has come to encompass a wide variety of phenomena and mechanisms, creating the important challenge of understanding how they contribute to network function and behaviour. Here, we present a framework for considering potential roles of metaplasticity across three domains of function. First, metaplasticity appears ideally placed to prepare for subsequent learning by either enhancing learning ability generally or by preparing neuronal networks to encode specific content. Second, metaplasticity can homeostatically regulate synaptic plasticity, and this likely has important behavioural consequences by stabilising synaptic weights while ensuring the ongoing availability of synaptic plasticity. Finally, we discuss emerging evidence that metaplasticity mechanisms may play a role in disease causally and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.},

abstract = {The brain representation of the body, called the body schema, is susceptible to plasticity. For instance, subjects experiencing a rubber hand illusion develop a sense of ownership of a mannequin hand when they view it being touched while tactile stimuli are simultaneously applied to their own hand. Here, the cortical basis of such an embodiment was investigated through concurrent recordings from primary somatosensory (i.e., S1) and motor (i.e., M1) cortical neuronal ensembles while two monkeys observed an avatar arm being touched by a virtual ball. Following a period when virtual touches occurred synchronously with physical brushes of the monkeys' arms, neurons in S1 and M1 started to respond to virtual touches applied alone. Responses to virtual touch occurred 50 to 70 ms later than to physical touch, consistent with the involvement of polysynaptic pathways linking the visual cortex to S1 and M1. We propose that S1 and M1 contribute to the rubber hand illusion and that, by taking advantage of plasticity in these areas, patients may assimilate neuroprosthetic limbs as parts of their body schema.},

abstract = {Our ability to manipulate objects dexterously relies fundamentally on sensory signals originating from the hand. To restore motor function with upper-limb neuroprostheses requires that somatosensory feedback be provided to the tetraplegic patient or amputee. Given the complexity of state-of-the-art prosthetic limbs and, thus, the huge state space they can traverse, it is desirable to minimize the need for the patient to learn associations between events impinging on the limb and arbitrary sensations. Accordingly, we have developed approaches to intuitively convey sensory information that is critical for object manipulation-information about contact location, pressure, and timing-through intracortical microstimulation of primary somatosensory cortex. In experiments with nonhuman primates, we show that we can elicit percepts that are projected to a localized patch of skin and that track the pressure exerted on the skin. In a real-time application, we demonstrate that animals can perform a tactile discrimination task equally well whether mechanical stimuli are delivered to their native fingers or to a prosthetic one. Finally, we propose that the timing of contact events can be signaled through phasic intracortical microstimulation at the onset and offset of object contact that mimics the ubiquitous on and off responses observed in primary somatosensory cortex to complement slowly varying pressure-related feedback. We anticipate that the proposed biomimetic feedback will considerably increase the dexterity and embodiment of upper-limb neuroprostheses and will constitute an important step in restoring touch to individuals who have lost it.},

These categories are informed by knowledge of the way that objects co-occur in natural scenes. How does the human brain aggregate information about objects to represent scene categories? To explore this issue, we used statistical learning methods to learn categories that objectively capture the co-occurrence statistics of objects in a large collection of natural scenes. Using the learned categories, we modeled fMRI brain signals evoked in human subjects when viewing images of scenes. We find that evoked activity across much of anterior visual cortex is explained by the learned categories. Furthermore, a decoder based on these scene categories accurately predicts the categories and objects comprising novel scenes from brain activity evoked by those scenes. These results suggest that the human brain represents scene categories that capture the co-occurrence statistics of objects in the world.},

Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) aim to improve the quality of life for large numbers of neurological patients. In particular, this novel technology is meant to play a major role in the near future as a serious contribution to spinal cord rehabilitation. During the last decade we have witnessed a dramatic increase in BMI research with impressive demonstrations of rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans controlling robots, wheelchairs, and graphical cursors in real time through signals collected from the brain. In this chapter we first review the different techniques used in the field of BMI, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and chronic multielectrode recordings. In addition we review the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for noninvasive modulation of excitability in relatively focal cortical areas. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the future implications of BMIs for directing functional movement and improving function after spinal injury in humans.},

abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that allows its users to control external devices with brain activity. Although the proof-of-concept was given decades ago, the reliable translation of user intent into device control commands is still a major challenge. Success requires the effective interaction of two adaptive controllers: the user's brain, which produces brain activity that encodes intent, and the BCI system, which translates that activity into device control commands. In order to facilitate this interaction, many laboratories are exploring a variety of signal analysis techniques to improve the adaptation of the BCI system to the user. In the literature, many machine learning and pattern classification algorithms have been reported to give impressive results when applied to BCI data in offline analyses. However, it is more difficult to evaluate their relative value for actual online use. BCI data competitions have been organized to provide objective formal evaluations of alternative methods. Prompted by the great interest in the first two BCI Competitions, we organized the third BCI Competition to address several of the most difficult and important analysis problems in BCI research. The paper describes the data sets that were provided to the competitors and gives an overview of the results.},

abstract = {Antidepressant treatments enhance plasticity and increase neurogenesis in the adult brain, but it has been unclear how these effects influence mood. We propose that, like environmental enrichment and exercise, antidepressant treatments enhance adaptability by increasing structural variability within the nervous system at many levels, from proliferating precursors to immature synaptic contacts. Conversely, sensory deprivation and chronic stress reduce this structural variability. Activity-dependent competition within the mood-related circuits, guided by rehabilitation, then selects for the survival and stabilization of those structures that best represent the internal or external milieu. Increased variability together with competition-mediated selection facilitates normal function, such as pattern separation within the dentate gyrus and other mood-related circuits, thereby enhancing adaptability toward novel experiences.},

abstract = {Pain and fear are both aversive experiences that strongly impact on behaviour and well being. They are considered protective when they lead to meaningful, adaptive behaviour such as the avoidance of situations that are potentially dangerous to the integrity of tissue (pain) or the individual (fear). Pain and fear may, however, become maladaptive if expressed under inappropriate conditions or at excessive intensities for extended durations. Currently emerging concepts of maladaptive pain and fear suggest that basic neuronal mechanisms of memory formation are relevant for the development of pathological forms of pain and fear. Thus, the processes of erasing memory traces of pain and fear may constitute promising targets for future therapies.},

@article{Giurfa2013,
abstract = {Insects possess miniature brains but exhibit a sophisticated behavioral repertoire. Recent studies have reported the existence of unsuspected cognitive capabilities in various insect species that go beyond the traditionally studied framework of simple associative learning. Here, I focus on capabilities such as attentional modulation and concept learning and discuss their mechanistic bases. I analyze whether these behaviors, which appear particularly complex, can be explained on the basis of elemental associative learning and specific neural circuitries or, by contrast, require an explanatory level that goes beyond simple associative links. In doing this, I highlight experimental challenges and suggest future directions for investigating the neurobiology of higher-order learning in insects, with the goal of uncovering the basic neural architectures underlying cognitive processing.},
